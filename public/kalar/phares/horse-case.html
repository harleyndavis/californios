&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Few Interesting Facts about John Pharis &#038; his son Robert, of Pendleton County, 
(West) Virginia, from an Obscure Chancery Court Case. <BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These original court papers of Pendleton County Virginia 
reside in a box of loose papers, and have been microfilmed and are available through Latter 
Day Saint&#0146;s Family History Centers Library system, Microfilm #186499, (see Envelope #3). 
These <I>few</I> extractions 
from those records were taken from 18 pages of photocopies made from that microfilm.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Pendleton County, then Virginia, now West Virginia, there was a law 
suit over monies involving John Pharis, Plaintive, and Peter Veneman, Defendant. A gray horse is 
often mentioned in that case, hence we call it, the &#0147;Horse Case.&#0148; <BR><BR>

<CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Pharis, later to live in Randolph County Virginia, is the son of John Phares, 
of Pendleton County Virginia. Confirmed by Rob<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT>. Pharis&#0146;s  deposition, 
19 August 1790, in Pendleton County. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Phares, father of Rob<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT> was married 
twice; the first wife died in &#0147;the last of the Year 1778,&#0148; and then John married his second wife 
in April or May 1779. From Seraiah Stratton&#0146;s deposition.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1779, John Pharis moved to the plantation of Tho<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>s</U></SUP></FONT> 
Wilmoth. In John Smith&#0146;s deposition, we see the Plantation referred to as, &#0147;Margret Willmoth&#0146;s.&#0148; 
It is possible but not proven here that Tho<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>s</U></SUP></FONT> Wilmoth died and John Pharis 
married the widow, Margret Wilmoth. The plantation&#0146;s location is given as being in the Buffalo Hills, which is 
an area just northwest of Franklin. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tombstone of Rob<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT> Pharis is located 
in the Phares-Pritt Cemetery in Valley Bend, Randolph County, West Virginia.  The stone shows &#0147;Robert 
Phares  Died Oct. 2, 1823  In his 62 Yr.&#0148; therefore we place his birth as 1760/1. This and the 
fact that Rob<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT> was &#0147;of full age&#0148; in 1790, in order 
to give the deposition, shows that Rob<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT> had to be the son of 
the <I>first</I> wife of John Phares.  <BR><BR>

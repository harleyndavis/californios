&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Pendleton County Virginia law suit, John Pharis <I>vs.</I> Peter Veneman, we see the Phares name
spelled three ways, <I>Phares</I>, <I>Pharis</I>, and <I>Faris</I>. One original document is signed with an <B><I>X</I></B> mark, 
and the name John Faris was written in by another person. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is reasonable to assume that John was illiterate and did not know how to spell his name, 
and so the person who wrote the document simply spelled it phonetically; hence the spelling <I>Faris</I>.  One of the other of the original 
documents is a deposition by Robert Phares. He is literate and so he properly signs a deposition with his name. Robert also mentions 
his father in the deposition so there is no question that Robert Phares is the son of John &#0147;Faris.&#0148; <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also reasonable to expect to see variations of Phares surname such as Pharis, 
Faris, Farris, etc. Doing Phares research in early New Jersey records, the variations become appearent. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was commonplace in early America for surnames to be misspelled and even changed. Often, the court 
clerks receive the blame for this, but if the a person could not spell his own name, how is the clerk to know?  <BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#006600" SIZE="+1">NOTE:</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  All the handwriting on the recording of this Deed of Lease appear to be in the same 
hand except the name of Jacob K&#0246;hler. That name is in a different hand and is in what 
is called <A HREF="graphics/german-script.gif">Old German Script</A>.   <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The deed could have been written by a local lawyer or other person who was not aware of 
the actual spelling of the K&#0246;hler name, hence we see Keylor and Kayler in the deed. However the K&#0246;hler 
spelling reveals the true German spelling of the name. It was the normal practice of the County Clerk to accurately copy 
the original document. Normally, the clerk&#0146;s copy of the document would not contain original signatures. Still, 
this deed has the anomaly in that the one name, Jacob K&#0246;hler is not in the clerk&#0146;s hand. Could this be in 
Jacob K&#0246;hler hand? Or maybe the clerk made serious attempt to copy the name accurately. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The next question is, How could K&#0246;hler become Keylor or even Kayler? 
The answer is <I>phonetics</I>.  English speaking, non-German writers often spelled German names 
the way they <I>sounded</I>.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We see the <B>&#0246;</B>, a letter <B>o</B>, with the diacritic (diacritical 
mark) <SUP><B>..</B></SUP> which is called the <I>umlaut</I>. That letter, <B>&#0246;</B>, does not sound like 
the letter <B>o</B>. It sounds more like the letter <B>a</B>.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For clarity, we have shown the name K&#0246;hler from the original recording plus two created 
versions in the Old German Script. Notice the third letter which looks exactly like the long <B>s</B> 
seen in American scripts until the mid-1800s. In the Old German Script, it is the letter <B>h</B>, not <B>s</B>. Here is
an example of the American long <B>s</B>:   
<BR> <IMG SRC="graphics/miss1.gif"> <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lastly, we used a commercially available font, <I>Kurrent Kupferstich</I>, from 
<A HREF="http://www.waldenfont.com/">Walden Fonts Co.</A>, to create the third example on our graphic. 
This font is a good tool for those wanting to learn Old German Script.  <BR>

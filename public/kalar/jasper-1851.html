&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Memories of Mary J. Kalar. Aged 90 years.  <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Jonathan Channell born March 2, l811 in Barbour Co. W. Va. was my father. He 
married Edith Sayers, my mother and raised  seven children, of which I am the 
youngest. The rest of the family are dead.  <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
After my father and mother were married they lived on a farm in Barbour Co. 
My mother died in 1861;  then came the Civil War, lasting 4 years. My father then 
sold out and moved to Tucker Co. near the East Va. line (but in W. Va.).  I drove 
one team of mov_ and my father drove the other one. We had two wagons full of 
household goods. We were two days on the road, going about 70 miles. <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
My father married again in 1865 and lived there until his death in 1873. I was 
away doing housework for people and they sent for me; but he was dead when I 
got home. So I stayed up there an made my home with the neighbors, Isaac and 
Martin Gilmore until I got married in 1875 to Jasper Kalar. We were married on 
his birthday, Oct. 7, 1875 in Tucker Co. W. Va. He was born in I851.  <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
My husband was always a farmer and lived in the old homestead until we built a 
new house on higher ground to get away from the flood at flood time. We lived 
in the new house 6 years, then sold out and came to Belmont Ohio, Belmont Co. 
We have lived here about 36 years. Jasper died in 1921 after suffering for 4 years 
with  [TB]. Olive B. Kalar in Pittsburg and Stark F. Kalar in Bowen Ky. I have 
nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. I reared my granddaughter, 
Edith Minch, who is taking care of me now. She is now married to Herbert Fitch , 
who is a soldier, overseas at the present, in the war. <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
My maiden name was Mary Jane Channell and I was born Oct. 20, 1852. <BR><BR>
<CENTER>Yours sincerely, <BR><BR>
/s/ Mary J. Kalar  </CENTER><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">(Source: This transcription is from a very poor

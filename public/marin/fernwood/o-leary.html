&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The monument to Katie and Minnie O'Leary is found in the "Sausalito Section" of <I>Forever Fernwood Cemetery</I>, Mill Valley. Both died during late 1890. <I>The Sausalito News</I> reported that the first burial in the "Sausalito New Cemetery" occurred in late <A HREF="domergue.html">December, 1891<A>. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the O'Leary girls' parents, Cornelius O'Leary and his wife Margaret, were Sausalito residents and the newspaper tells us Minnie O'Leary was interred in Sausalito, it is possible that the two O'Leary girls were first interred in Sausalito's older Sunny Hill Cemetery and that later their remains were moved to the new Sausalito Cemetery on Coyote Creek. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newly created <I>Sausalito Cemetery Association</I> filed its Section Map with the Marin County Recorder on September 15, 1892. The first sale occured September 27, 1892. In 1893 and after, people "wishing bodies of deceased friends and relatives removed to the new Sausalito Cemetery" from Sunny Hill Cemetery were advised via the newspapers to contact the Marin County Coroner. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Cornelius O'Leary did not purchase the burial site for his family until February 23, 1895, <I><A HREF="18950225.jpg">E &#0189;, Lot 36, Block 7, Section "E"</A></I>. This is the same location where we see the O'Leary monument today. The two O'Leary girls needed to be buried <I>somewhere</I> between the time of their death in 1890 and their father's purchase of the &#0189; Lot 36 in 1895. Sunny Hill Cemetery seems to be the most likely candidate for those two earlier burials. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The funeral of Catherine Domergue, whose death notice apperaed in our issue of this date, 
took place from the family residence in Sausalito last Sunday. The last funeral rites were conducted by 
the very Rev. Father Valentine at St. Mary's Cathedral, Sausalito. After a very impressive service by the
Rev. gentleman, the funeral cortege moved to Sausalito New Cemetery, this being the first interment in the 
new burial ground. Out of respect to a brother Forester, Court Star of California, Sausalito, No. 7813 
of the Ancient Order of Foresters, the following brothers acted as pall-bearers: Charles Burrey, D.H.G.R.: 
Paul Trouette, J.E. Creed, Judge Simpton, R.S.; Ed Wosser, S.W.; Fred Lindsey, several members of the 
Order joining in solemn procession. Mrs. Domergue had been a great sufferer for twelve months. "Her 
end was peace." <BR><BR>

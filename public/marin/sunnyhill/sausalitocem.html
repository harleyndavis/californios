Sausalito Cemetery (<A HREF="#1">1</A>) <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The petition for the removal of the burial place from its present
locality (<A HREF="#2">2</A>) was submitted to the Board of the S.L. 
and F. Co.(<A HREF="#3">3</A>) at its last meeting with the following results. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Board had already decided that the present location is too close
to premises now occupied, or that will be occupied in the near future
by resident families, and had selected a site in the opinion of the
Board--more suitable in very many respects and not subject to the
objection, sure to be made by near by residents, to the present
locality, who eventually would demand its removal as has been the case
in San Francisco and elsewhere. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The company intends making a cemetery on the proposed site suitable,
desirable and <I>lasting</I> as well as ornamental. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
It is only taking advantage of the experience of other communities in
placing it at the outset far enough away from dwelling places to
insure that it shall not be disturbed or the necessity arise for its
removal, as our population increases. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The site will be shortly enclosed with a substantial fence, walkways
and driveways made, trees planted and other requisite work for use,
and ornament done. Roads of approach will be opened, which will give
three main routes of access. viz: by the county road and Cayote creek
route to the foot of the cemetery hill; by Alta Avenue, via the
streets of town and Spencer avenue, along the crest of the hill, to
the upper part of the site; or by Rodeo avenue, past the present
burial place to Alta avenue and thence to the cemetery. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Lots of sizes to suit all requiring them will be laid out and
distinctly marked and defined, and will be sold at reasonable rates.
The company intends to devote most of the proceeds of the sales to the
improvement and beautifying of the grounds, so that not only our own
residents, but those from other communities wanting a resting place
for their dead, will seek the Sausalito Cemetery for the purpose. <BR><BR>

The Cemetery Committee appointed at the citizens meeting met at the "El Monte" Hotel, 
on Friday evening last. There were present Messrs. Sinkly, Reed, Furlong, Lawrence 
and Loriano.

&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The object of the meeting was to determine upon a course of action with reference 
to the propositions made by the Land Company asking for a guaranty. It was agreed 
in Committee that the members should canvass their neighborhoods to learn the 
individual feelings of citizens giving a pledge to buy lots in the proposed tract.

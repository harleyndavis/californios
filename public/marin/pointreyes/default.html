<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2">Guardsmen and Rangers to Restore Old Gravesites</FONT> <BR><BR>

By Rhonda Parks</CENTER><BR> <DIV ALIGN="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Members of the Point Reyes Coast Guard Station this Thursday were
scheduled to restore a gravesite in the National Seashore where 11
officers of the former US Lifesaving Service at Point Reyes lie buried
under tall grass.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two of the gravesites were first discovered in 1959 by rancher Joe
Lunny. The larger of the sites contains the remains of Captain Henry
Claussen, the first commanding officer of the Lifesaving Station, and
his family. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Graves near the Claussen family site contain the remains of officers
John Korpola, George Larson, Andrew Anderson and Fred Carstens, all of
whom served at the Life Saving Station. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Created in 1860 as a branch of the Treasury Department, the Lifesaving
Service was absorbed by the Coast Guard in 1915. The site of the old
lifesaving station now houses the Coast Guards' west coast
communications station. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Coast Guard Chief Bruce Elliott said he and nine other men -- members
of both the Coast Guard and National Park Service -- will clean up the
gravesites Thursday - "in memory and
respect for the forerunners of the present day Coast Guard. " <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"We plan to mow the high grass around the gravestones, cut the trees,
and paint and repair the fences," Chief Elliott said. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the graves were first discovered in the late 1950s, a Coast Guard
Commander had officers search the records for circumstances
surrounding the death of members of the Claussen family and Lifesaving
Service officers. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The log of the Lifesaving Station contains accounts of how the
servicemen died:  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI>Andrew Anderson, Fred Carstens: At 10 a.m. on Dec. 12, 1890, the
boat crew was trying to pull a boat up on the beach when a large wave
came in, overturned the boat, and injured both men. They were
transported to a dwelling and the doctor was called but arrived too
late. Both men died at 11: 10 a.m. Dec. 13, 1890. Reverend McCoy
preached a double funeral the next day. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI> John Korpala: At 8 p.m. March 2, 1891, Korpala complained of
having chills and a severe headache. At 6:30 a.m. March 3 he was found
dead in the bed in his room. The coroner said Koipala died from a
hemorrhage in his lungs. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI> George Larson: On March 1, 1893, while practicing with a boat in
the surf, Larson was killed when a breaker came in and turned the boat
over. Larson was struck by the gunwale of the boat and killed
instantly. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI> Hinrik Claussen (1819-1872): He died of blood poisoning from an
insect bite . His son, Capt. Peter Claussen, officiated at the
service. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI>Agneta Claussen: The wife of Capt. Claussen, she died on 1877 of
unknown reasons. Her husband officiated at the ceremony. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI> Christiane Claussen: The Captain's second wife, she died in 1892
giving birth to their first son, Henry. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI> Capt. Henry. Claussen: He died Nov. 13, 1915, after a three- year
illness diagnosed as massive stroke. He was buried along side his
mother. <BR><BR>

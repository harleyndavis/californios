Marin County Hospital Cemetery, a.k.a. Paupers Cemetery, Poor House Cemetery, Marin Farm, etc.
On Jeanette Prandi Way.  At one time, associated with the Marin County Hospital. Take Lucas Valley Road, west of Hwy 101. turn north Mt. Lassen Drive to Jeanette Prandi Way, turn east on Jeanette Prandi Way and follow road to the east end. The cemetery is on the north side of the road and opposite of Marin County Parks and Open Space office, 18 Jeanette Prandi Way. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Cemetery is not fenced and has no identifying sign. It has no visible gravemarkers, although there are rumors that some flat gravemarkers are buried there. County keeps the cemetery mowed but unidentifiable to the uninformed general public. Also rumored that the county has not interest in expending funds on the cemetery, because of the lack of gravemarkers. Last reported burial in the county cemetery is 1964. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Commonly, sick jail and prison inmates are brought to the county hospitals, so it is possible that some inmates from the county jail or San Quentin prison may have been interred in the Marin County Hospital Cemetery along with indigent people. Looking for a buried, flat gravemarker might not prove fruitful. Check the microfilms of old newspaper and other records at the main Marin County Free Library, 3501 Civic Center Drive, Room #414, San Rafael, CA 94903, Phone: (415) 499-6051. Also highly recommended, check in their California Room at the library. They have card file index with names that appear in the old newspapers. <BR><BR>

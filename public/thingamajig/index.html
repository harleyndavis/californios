Learned Opinions from an Exclusive Mailing List</B></FONT> <BR><BR>
<LI> I dunno what it is and ain&#0146;t saying what I think it looks like ... <BR><BR>  
<LI> ... oil lamp for a ship/sailing vessel. <BR><BR>
<LI> I would say it was a time piece, but ... I am not saying anything further.... <BR><BR>
<LI> It&#0146;s a woman wearing a bikini. <BR><BR>
<LI> ... a flower vase or maybe it was some kind of lighting device.... oil lamp...?? <BR><BR>
<LI> I'll go with an oil lamp. <BR><BR>

<LI> It is clearly a Thingamabob. <BR><BR>
<LI> ... a well hung bota. <BR><BR>

<LI> Perhaps it was meant to hang from the ceiling in a ship or even a kitchen,....and when 
one tilts it over, one can pour a glass of wine. <BR><BR>

<LI> A Texican on a Bicycle. <BR><BR>
<LI> 1850&#0146;s prototype for a chastity belt. <BR><BR>
<LI> A Barometer. <BR><BR>
<LI>It&#0146;s a Horowitz 1872 Model B Barometer used for forcasting air pressure 
by weather stations.  Manufactured in Boston, Mass.  It should have a 
tube coming out the top of the lower portion and extending up a couple 
of inches.  The tube, which had a scale on it, is where the air pressure 
was read. <BR>
<DD> <I>Response to Above (1.):</I> Without the tube ..., it would be a very impotent barometer indeed. <BR>

<DD> <I>Response to Above (2.):</I>  Sooooo..the barometer pressure goes up when she pulls her top up and down 
when she ..umm..Uhhhh..(I&#0146;ll think of something)  OH...gets ready to clean 
her tatoo. <BR><BR>

bar-b-qued ham, if that is any help to you.</FONT>

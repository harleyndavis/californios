<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#000099">Introduction</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modern Germany came into being in 1871 with 
the establishment of the German Empire (Deutsches Reich). However, Germany&#0146;s 
pre-history starts back in the mists of time when the first people settled 
there. In the first millennium before Christ, the Celts inhabited the southern part 
of Germany and the eastern part of Gaul (France), with a culture that 
in time stretched from Britain and Ireland, into Spain and northern Italy, and 
from the German highlands into the Balkans, and with a Celtic colony in Galatia (Turkey). 
Unfortunately, the Celts had no written language to tell us about themselves or the 
Druid religion that is associated with them. We only find some few 
classical contemporary written references to the Celts from early Greek 
and Roman authors. The pre-history of Germany&#0146;s early people is 
therefore a study that falls to the archeologist and the anthropologist<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The later migration of Germanic people 
from the east is considered by some to be the start of European history. (Greek and Roman 
history is considered Mediterranean history.) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an overlap of German and Mediterranean 
history and there were events that happened with the Romans that caused great changes 
to the Germanic people. So we start our time line with the Romans. <BR>

who first resisted, then invaded, and at length overturned the Western monarchy of 
Rome, will occupy a much more important place in this history, and possess a stronger, 
and, if we may use the expression, a more domestic, claim to our attention and regard. 
The most civilized nations of modern Europe issued from the woods of Germany; and in the 
rude institutions of those barbarians we may still distinguish the original principles 
of our present laws and manners.&#0148;</FONT> <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Caesar came to Gaul, the Romans were 
already in control of the southern most part, Gallia Narbonensis (from 121 BC) which 
today we know as Provence in France. 
It was the main province of the Roman Empire. The rest of Gaul was free and divided 
among Celtic tribes. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main Celtic tribes north of Provence were 
the rival Aedui and the Sequani. The Aedui had been more receptive to Roman influence. 
The Sequani made an alliance with some <I>Germans</I> and with their help defeated the Aedui 
tribes. The Sequani established themselves as the leading tribe in Gaul. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arverni were allies of the Sequani. 
An Arverni chief, Celtius, proclaimed himself King of all free Gaul. 
He was soon murdered; his son Vercingetorix blamed the Romans. He organized a 
rebellion against the Romans. Julius Caesar moved against Vercingetorix and eventually 
Vercingetorix surrendered and Gaul was in Roman hands. <BR>

Massacre (the Varus Battle)  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the reign of Augustus Caesar, three 
Roman legions are destroyed in the Teutoburg Forest (Teutoberger Wald), Germania 
Inferior, during a revolt led by 
Arminius (sometimes called Hermann). Arminius, a Cherusci chief who had 
served in the Roman army in a Germanic auxiliary 
 is considered a German national hero. After this Roman defeat, few Roman armies 
dared to cross over the Rhine, except in response to German raids. <BR>

(<A HREF="../maps/roman-line.gif">Map</A>) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While German areas protected by the static 
Limes set a defensive boundary for the Romans, and some areas behind the Limes became 
somewhat Romanized, greater Germany remained un-Romanized. Hence the German 
language remained old German, even with all its variations. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the time of Augustus Caesar the 
first military fortress Vetera I was established on the Fuerstenberg. The fortress 
acted as a base for the conquest of East-Rheinland Germany. Following the defeat 
in the battle of Teutoburg Forest, the Rhine river became the border of the Roman 
Empire. During the revolt of the native Batavians, Vetera I was destroyed. Vetera II 
was constructed at a new site. A legion was stationed here from 70 to 270. 
The civilian settlement was elevated to the rank of colony around 100. The 
expansion of the Franks ended the town&#0146;s period of prosperity in 276. <BR>

Austria from the German Confederation as a step toward the unification of Germany under 
Prussian dominance. 


Prussia was allied with Italy and a few small North German states; Austria was seconded by Bavaria,

quickly occupied Hanover, Electoral Hesse, Nassau, and Frankfurt. The Prussians then pushed into Bohemia

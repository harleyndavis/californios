&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to quell the disturbances in 
the American colonies, in 1775 British King George III purchased the 
services of 30,000 German Soldiers to augment his British regulars. These 
German soliders were transported to America where they made up approximately 
one-third of the King&#0146;s army in the colonies. The British paid the equivalent of $150,000 
for the services of the German soldiers, all of which went into the royal treasuries 
of the German Princes. The German soldiers profitted little from the arrangement. <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American colonists were offended that 
King George III had turned foreign enemies loose on them. The colonists referred 
to all of the German soldiers as Hessians and as mercenaries. There were a great 
many pro-Britain, pro-Crown Tories and politically neutral people in the colonies. 
The introduction of foreign mercenaries into the mix did did not sit well with the 
colonists and even today, we can find distain toward the Hessians here in the 
United States. The term Hessian has entered our lexicon of regional English, 
especially in the area of New England southward to Georgia. <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all of the German soldiers came from 
principalities other than Hesse-Kassal and Hesse-Hanau. Since the command of the 
German force was Hessian and the Hessians made up the majority of the soliders, 
the term Hessian was applied to of the German soliders. <BR><BR>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These troops came from Hesse-Kassel, 
Hesse-Hanau, Brunswick, Anspach, Bayreuth, Anhalt Zerbst and Waldeck. <BR><BR>

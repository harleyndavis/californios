&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of a German tribe, and also 
a district in Germany extending along the Lahn, Eder, Fulda, Werra, and 
the Lower Main and Rhine. The district comprises today the Grand Duchy of 
Hesse-Darmstadt and the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau (capital, Kassel). 
The territory of the Hessians -- the descendants of the Chatti, who, with 
the Cherusci, were masters of Germany before the Roman domination -- was 
divided during the period of the Frankish empire into several <I>Gaue</I> 
(i. e. districts -- Saxon Hessengau, Frankish Hessengau, Buchonia, Oberlahngau, 
etc.), ruled over by counts.  <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 350 Christianity  was preached in a 
portion of this territory by St. Lubentius of Trier, who built a church at 
Dietkirchen near Limburg. In the sixth century St. Goar preached the Gospel 
along the Rhine, while in the following century St. Kilian (d. 689) preached 
in the districts along the Main and the Rh&#0246;n. The chief missionary of the 
Hessians was St. Boniface. He baptized two counts at Am&#0246;neburg about 722, 
founded a Benedictine abbey there, felled the celebrated sacred oak of Thor at 
Geismar, and founded at B&#0220;raberg near Fritzlar the first Hessian bishopric 
in 741, consolidated with Mainz in 774, and also the monastery of St. Peter at 
Fritzlar. Commissioned by the saint, his disciple Sturmi founded the monastery 
of Fulda and St. Lullus the Abbey of Hersfeld. From these centres of Christian 
culture many religious communities and cloisters were founded on the conclusion 
of the Saxon wars, and Christianity subsequently made rapid progress among the 
people. The greater portion of the land was throughout the Middle Ages under 
the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Archbishops of Mainz; the smaller 
portion under the exempt Abbots of Fulda and Hersfeld, or under the Bishops 
of Trier (10 churches in Lahngau) and Paderborn (4).  <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the weak successors of Charles the 
Great, the old constitution of the <I>Gaue</I> gradually changed, and the counts (<I>Grafen</I>) 
from responsible officials became independent lords. As the bishops and monasteries 
also acquired much landed property, Hesse was parcelled up into numerous territories. 
Among the Hessian nobility, the most prominent in the tenth and eleventh centuries 
were the Counts of Ziegenhain, of Felsberg, of Schaumburg, of Diez, but above all 
the Gisos, Counts of Gudensberg. The daughter of the fourth and last Giso married 
in 1122 Count Louis I of Thuringia, who in 1130 was raised to the rank of landgrave 
by Emperor Lothair. As the Hessian nobility recognized him as their overlord, Hesse 
was thus united with Thuringia. Louis at the same time received the protectorate of 
the most important religious foundations of the land, and for a period of more than 
a century the union of Hesse and Thuringia continued unbroken. With Henry Raspe, the 
brother-in-law of St. Elizabeth of Thuringia, the male line of the Thuringian 
landgraves became extinct in 1247, whereupon the Hessians chose Henry of Brabant, 
Elizabeth&#0146;s grandson, as their landgrave. Hesse was separated from Thuringia, 
and, after a long struggle with other claimants of the title, Henry established his 
authority as Landgrave of Hesse. For a large portion of his territories he owed fealty 
to the Archbishop of Mainz; for his allodial estate and the imperial fiefs which he 
possessed, he received in 1292 from King Adolph of Nassau the hereditary rank of prince 
of the empire. He chose Kassel as his residence, and from him is descended the present 
princely house of Hesse, which can thus trace its line back to St. Elizabeth.  <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the acquisition of previously independent 
territories (Giessen, Treffurt, Schmalkalden, Katzenellenbogen, Diez, etc,) 
Henry&#0146;s successors increased the domain of the landgraviate to such an 
extent that it became one of the most powerful German principalities. Hermann 
I (1377-1413) played an important r&#0244;le in ecclesiastical affairs. Intended 
originally for Holy Orders and surnamed &#0147;the learned&#0148; on account of 
his love of the sciences, he espoused during the Great Schism the cause of Gregory 
XII in opposition to Mainz. The slumbering quarrel with Mainz broke out under 
Hermann&#0146;s son, Louis I the Peaceful (1413-58), and Archbishop Conrad of 
Mainz suffered a decisive defeat at Fulda in 1427. The schism and the wrangles 
between the landgraves and the archbishops greatly contributed to disturb 
ecclesiastical order, and in many of the numerous monasteries the ancient 
discipline had fallen into decay. On the whole, however, the Hessian Church 
was in an excellent condition at the outbreak of the Reformation in Germany.  <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated divisions, all the Hessian lands 
were reunited by William II. Philip the Magnanimous (1509-67), William&#0146;s son 
and successor, at first adopted a hostile attitude towards the doctrines of Luther, 
which soon found adherents in the Franciscan Jacob Limburg of Marburg and the 
Augustinian provincial Tilemann Schnabel of Alsfeld. He banished or imprisoned 
the heretical preachers, and came to be regarded by them as the most dangerous 
opponent of &#0147;the Gospel&#0148;. In 1525, however, he was won over to 
Protestantism by Joachim Camerarius and Melanchthon, who wrote for him the 
&#0147;Epitome renovat&#0230; ecclesiastic&#0230; doctrin&#0230;&#0148;. 
The recess of the Diet of Speyer in 1526 enabled him to set up a territorial 
Church. At a synod of the higher dignitaries of the regular and secular 
clergy at Homberg in October, 1526, the reform regulations devised by the 
ex-Franciscan, Lambert of Avignon, were adopted. The Franciscan guardian, 
Nikolaus Ferber of Marburg, alone raised his voice against their adoption, 
but his protest was disregarded. At the Convention of Hitzkirch, in 1528, 
the Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, found himself compelled to 
waive temporarily his claims to ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Hesse. Thus 
the Reformatory ordinances (<I>Reformationsordnung</I>) -- which were of an 
extreme type, rejecting the Mass, feasts of the saints, pilgrimages, pictures, 
relics, etc. -- spread rapidly over the country. Foundations and monasteries 
were suppressed, their property confiscated, public worship forbidden to 
Catholics. To establish the new teaching on a firmer basis the first Protestant 
university was founded at Marburg in 1527, while the Rituals of 1537, 1539, 
and 1566, in the composition of which Bucer&#0146;s influence is unmistakable, 
fixed the constitution of the Hessian Church on an episcopal synodal basis. <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philip&#0146;s imprisonment by Charles V 
scarcely exercised a perceptible influence on the progress of the Reformation, 
and in 1551 Sebastian von Heusenstamm, Archbishop of Mainz, was compelled to 
resign finally all claims to jurisdiction in Hesse. In this manner was the 
Church founded by St. Boniface almost entirely annihilated. The Reformation 
was also introduced into the territories which were subsequently (e. g. in 1648) 
acquired by Hesse; only in the domain of the Abbey of Fulda and in a few enclaves 
belonging to the Archbishopric of Mainz (Fritzlar, Am&#0246;neburg, Neustadt) did 
the Catholic Faith survive. Philip the Magnanimous divided Hesse at his death 
among his four legitimate sons, but, as two of these died without heirs in 1583 
and 1604 respectively, his family was split into two chief lines -- that of 
Hesse-Darmstadt, represented by George I, and that of Hesse-Kassel, represented 
by William IV. From these two lines sprang in the course of time some collateral 
lines, but no member of the family at present occupies a throne. In contrast to 
his father, the first Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, George I (1567-96) espoused 
the cause of the Hapsburgs. He increased his family possessions considerably, 
and in this his example was followed by his eldest son Louis V (1596-1626), who 
for his attachment to the emperor was called &#0147;the Faithful&#0148;. He 
founded the University of Giessen in 1607. George II (1628-61) acquired a 
portion of Upper Hesse in 1648; his brother Frederick returned to the Catholic 
Faith, became Cardinal and Prince-Bishop of Breslau, and died in 1682. Although 
three sons of Louis VI (1661-78) also returned to Catholicism, there was no 
mitigation in the stern Lutheranism of the land. <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in the territory belonging to the 
collateral branch, Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, which became Catholic in 1652 
and extinct in 1834, was the Catholic Church tolerated. Landgraves Ernest 
Louis (1678-1739) and Louis VIII (1739-68) sought an understanding with Austria. 
Louis IX (1768-90) afforded free religious facilities to the Reformed Churches; 
in 1786 he granted to the Catholics Darmstadt as a &#0147;privilege&#0148; 
permission to hold Divine service. General freedom was first received by the 
Catholics under Louis X (1790-1830), who created the present Grand Duchy of Hesse. 
In the war against revolutionary France, the possessions of Hesse-Darmstadt on the 
right bank of the Rhine were ceded to the French by the Peace of Lun&#0233;ville, a 
few districts in Baden and Nassau being also lost. In compensation Louis received the 
Duchy of Westphalia, which had previously belonged to the Archdiocese of Cologne, 
and some districts in the Archdiocese of Mainz and the Bishopric of Worms, and 
later (1809) three Hessian domains of the German Order, the Fulda domain of Herbstein, 
and the estates of the Order of Malta in Hesse. In 1806 Louis received the title of 
Grand Duke (Louis I); at the Congress of Vienna he received in compensation for the 
Duchy of Westphalia, which fell to Prussia, the old ecclesiastical and palatinate 
lands on the left bank of the Rhine together with the towns Mainz and Worms. With 
the accession of such Catholic territories, the existing anomalous ecclesiastical 
conditions could no longer be maintained. Hesse therefore took part in the negotiations 
of several German states, which resulted in the erection of the ecclesiastical 
province of the Upper Rhine by the papal Bulls &#0147;Provida solersque&#0148; 
(1821) and &#0147;Ad Dominici gregis custodiam&#0148; (1827). In furtherance of 
the arrangements, the Grand Duchy of Hesse founded the new Bishopric of Mainz, 
which was made subject to the Archbishopric of Freiburg. Although the organic 
decrees of 1803 had created a kind of national Church, they were only partially 
carried out, and the position of the Catholic Church was here more favourable 
than in the other states of the ecclesiastical province of the Upper Rhine 
(e. g. in Baden). Under Louis III (1848-77), who began to rule during the 
lifetime of his father Louis II (1830-48), conditions were at first favourable 
to the Catholics. In 1854 Bishop Ketteler concluded with the Minister von 
Dalwigk the Convention of Mainz, which ensured for the Church a greater 
measure of freedom and independence, but on the other hand made great concessions 
to the State. In consequence of the opposition of the Estates, the convention 
had to be withdrawn in 1866. After the foundation of the German Empire, 
the <I>Kulturkampf</I> extended also to Hesse under the Liberal ministries 
of Hofmann and von Starck, that is from 1871 to 1884. The five ecclesiastical 
laws of 23 April, 1875, are in their <I>Kulturkampf</I> spirit an exact 
reproduction of the Prussian &#0147;May Laws&#0148;. After the death 
of Bishop Ketteler in 1877, the episcopal See of Mainz remained vacant until 
1886. It was only under Grand Duke Louis IV (1877-92) and during the Finger 
ministry, that the church laws were revised, and those of 1875 modified. 
Under Ernest Louis, who succeeded in 1892, further changes facilitated 
the admission of religious orders. (Concerning the ecclesiastical statistics 
of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, whose boundaries coincide with those of the 
Bishopric of Mainz, see MAINZ.) <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Hesse-Kassel William IV (1567-92) 
was succeeded by Moritz &#0147;the Learned&#0148; (1592-1627), during 
whose reign the Thirty Years&#0146; War broke out. His son, William V 
(1627-37), allied himself with Gustavus Adolphus and was forced to retire 
into exile. Under William VI (1637-63) the foundation of Hersfeld and a 
portion of Upper Hesse were acquired by Hesse-Kassel. The succeeding rulers 
were William VII (1663-70) and then Charles (1670-1730), whose son became 
King of Sweden as Frederick I in 1720, and later, during his government of 
Hesse (1730-51), was represented by his brother William (landgrave, 1751-60). 
William&#0146;s son, Frederick II, reverted to the Catholic Church in 1749, 
but, when his conversion became known, his father, in concert with the Estates, 
with Prussia, and Hanover, demanded that Frederick as landgrave should neither 
appoint a Catholic to a public position nor permit public Catholic worship. To 
these demands Frederick, to preserve his right of succession, was compelled to 
agree. During his reign (1760-85) the abuse of selling soldiers to England 
reached its culmination. In North America between 15,000 and 20,000 Hessians 
fought for England against the colonies struggling for freedom. His son, 
William IX (1785-1821), in accordance with the Peace of Lun&#0233;ville, 
received rich compensation (mostly in ecclesiastical territory) for Rheinfels, 
ceded to the French, and was granted in 1803 the title of elector. From 1806 to 
1813, Hesse-Kassel belonged to the Kingdom of Westphalia, founded by Napoleon. 
After the Restoration the greater part of the estates of the Abbey of Fulda was 
assigned to Hesse-Kassel. The Revolution of 1830 compelled William II (1821-47) 
to give the land a constitution which ensured to every citizen complete liberty 
of conscience and freedom to practise his religion. The status of Catholics was 
regulated by the erection of the ecclesiastical province of the Upper Rhine, when 
Electoral Hesse was placed under the Bishopric of Fulda. The profligacy of William 
II, the tyrannical rule of his son Frederick William I (1847-66), and the suppression 
of all political freedom caused an estrangement between princes and people. In the 
conflict between Prussia and Austria in 1866, when the elector, after a period of 
neutrality, voted against Prussia at the German Diet and ordered the mobilization 
of his troops, his territories were occupied by the Prussian army, and united with 
Prussia on 20 September, 1866, since which date they have shared the destiny of 
Prussia. It now forms with other territories acquired by Prussia in 1866 (the Duchy 
of Nassau, the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg, Frankfort-on-the-Main, etc.) the 
Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. The Catholics of the government district of 
Kassel and those of Bockenheim, one of the wards of the city of Frankfort, belong 
to the Diocese of Fulda; the remainder belong to the Diocese of Limburg. The 
ecclesiastical statistics will be found under these articles. <BR><BR>

&#0147;Workers and soldiers! The four war years were horrible, 
gruesome the sacrifices the people had to make in property and blood; 
the unfortunate war is over. The killing is over. The consequences of 
the war, need and suffering, will burden us for many years. The defeat 
we strove so hard to avoid, under all circumstances, has come upon us. 
Our suggestions regarding an understanding were sabotaged, we personally 
were mocked and ignored. The enemies of the working class, the real, inner 
enemies who are responsible for Germany&#0146;s collapse, they have turned silent 
and invisible. They were the home warriors, which upheld their conquest 
demands until yesterday, as obstinate as they fought the struggle against 
any reform of the constitution and especially of the deplorable Prussian 
election system. These enemies of the people are finished forever. The 
Kaiser has abdicated. He and his friends have disappeared; the people 
have won over all of them, in every field. Prince Max von Baden has 
handed over the office of Reich chancellor to representative Ebert. 
Our friend will form a new government consisting of workers of all 
socialist parties. This new government may not be interrupted, in 
their work to preserve peace and to care for work and bread. Workers 
and soldiers, be aware of the historic importance of this day: exorbitant 
things have happened. Great and incalculable tasks are waiting for us. 
Everything for the people. Everything by the people. Nothing may happen 
to the dishonour of the Labour Movement. Be united, faithful and conscientious. 
The old and rotten, the monarchy has collapsed. The new may live. Long live 
the German Republic!&#0148;

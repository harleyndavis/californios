&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Altenburg, is located in very eastern 
Th&#0252;ringia on the river Plei&#0223;e. It was first mentioned in documents dated 
from 976 A.D. From 1328 on it was in possession of the House of Wettin (Sachen). 
The rights of a free town were confirmed by Margrave Heinrich of Mei&#0223;en, Landgrave 
of Th&#0252;ringia, in 1256, and were renewed by Margrave Friedrich III of Mei&#0223;en 
in 1356. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Elector Friedrich II of Sachen  
died in 1464, his countries were jointly ruled by his sons, Ernst and Albrecht. 
In 1485 they divided the countries among themselves. Altenburg was among the 
countries received by Elector Ernst. After the War of Schmalkalden, Altenburg 
was in possession of the Albertine line of the family from 1547 until 1554 
when it passed to the Ernestine branch of the family. 
The Duchy Saxe-Altenburg was founded in 1603. <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
On the death of Friedrich Wilhelm I of Old Weimar and Old Altenburg in 1602, 
the Duchy was ruled by his four sons 1602-1625, by the three remaining 1625-1632, 
by the two remaining 1632-1639, and finally by the youngest alone Friedrich Wilhelm II 
1632-1669. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of the population 
of Altenburg was killed during the Thirty Years War (1618–1648). <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ernestine line became extinct in 1672 with the 
death of Duke Friedrich Wilhelm III of Saxe-Altenburg,  and Altenburg, Coburg, 
and Saalfeld passed to the New Gotha line. Three quarters of the country became part of the 
Duchy Saxe-Gotha, the rest became part of the Duchy Saxe-Weimar. <BR>

Frederick I (1680-1691), Frederick II (1691-1732), Frederick III (1732-1772), 
Ernest II (1772-1804), Augustus Ernest Leopold (1804-1822), Frederick IV (1822-1825). <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1680 Altenburg and 
Gotha were combined into a Duchy for Ernst the Piou&#0146;s oldest son 
Friedrich I.  
When Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg line became extinct in 1825, 
there was another great adjustment of territories and titles 
among the Th&#0252;ringian Saxon Duchies. The district of 
Gotha was granted to Saxe-Coburg and 
Altenburg itself was given to the Dukes of Saxe-Hildburghausen. 
The state was called Saxe-Altenburg therafter. <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frederick (V) (1825-1834),  
Joseph (1834-1848), George (1848-1853) Ernest I (1853-1908),  
Ernest II (1908-1918). <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1826, the Duchies were rearranged by 
the arbitration of King Friedrich August I of Sachen. The new Duchies were 
Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Coburg-and-Gotha Saxe-Altenburg which was awarded to 
Duke Friedrich of Saxe-Hildburghausen. 
Saxe-Altenburg joined the 
German Customs Union in 1833-34, the North German Federation in 1867, 
and the German Empire in 1871. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ernst II, the last 
Duke, abdicated in 1918. Saxe-Altenburg 
joined the newly-founded state of Th&#0252;ringia in 1920. <BR><BR>

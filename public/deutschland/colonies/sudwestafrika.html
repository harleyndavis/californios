&#0147;The inhospitable Namib Desert constituted a formidable barrier to 
European exploration until the late 18th century, when successions 
of travelers, traders, hunters, and missionaries explored the area. 
The 1878, the United Kingdom annexed Walvis Bay on behalf of Cape 
Colony, and the area was incorporated into the Cape of Good Hope in 
1884. In 1883, a German trader, Adolf Luderitz, claimed the rest of 
the coastal region after negotiations with a local chief. Negotiations 
between the United Kingdom and Germany resulted in Germany&#0146;s annexation 
of the coastal region, excluding Walvis Bay.<A HREF="#walvis">&#0134;</A> 
The following year, the 
United Kingdom recognized the hinterland up to 20 degrees east 
longitude as a German sphere of influence. A region, Caprivi Strip, 
became a part of South West Africa after an agreement on July 1, 1890, 
between the United Kingdom and Germany. The British recognized that the 
strip would fall under German administration to provide access to the 
Zambezi River and German colonies in East Africa. In exchange, the 
British received the islands of Zanzibar and Heligoland. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#0147;German colonial power was consolidated, and prime grazing land passed 
to white control as a result of the Herero and Nama wars of 1904-08. 
German administration ended during World War I following South African 
occupation in 1915.&#0148; <BR>

White-farm land-grab set for Namibia <BR>
192 properties listed for Zimbabwean-style confiscation <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#0147;SOSSOSVLEI, Namibia – Following the 
lead of neighboring Zimbabwe, the government of Namibia has announced a 
plan to confiscate white-owned farms. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#0147;President Sam Nujoma recently released 
a list of 192 farms to be confiscated. Among them are 99 farms owned by German 
nationals and another 91 owned by white South Africans. There are 350 
foreign-owned farms in Namibia. The total land area covered by these 192 
farms is four times the size of Luxembourg. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#0147;Namibia is a Marxist nation once part 
of apartheid South Africa. Its government is led by the Southwest Africa 
People&#0146;s Organization, or SWAPO, which was trained and funded by China in 
its war of liberation from white rule. Namibia was known as Southwest Africa 
until 1990, when the apartheid regime handed over control of the nation after 
a 15 year &#0145;Border War&#0146; against the Soviet Union and Cuba. Much of the land 
problem in Namibia stretches back to the tribal rebellions of the Nama and 
Herero between 1904 and 1907, which sent scores of black tribesmen out of their 
ancestral lands and created cheap labor for German colonial farmers ...&#0148; <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walvis Bay, the country&#0146;s 
only deep-water sea port was under British admistration before 
South Africa&#0146;s 1915 occupation of South West Africa. During 
World War I, Walvis Bay was administered jointly with South-West 
Africa from 1922 until 1978. South Africa retained control of 
the enclave for four years after South-West Africa&#0146;s 
independence as Namibia, ceding it to that country 
on 1 March 1994. <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle part of the German colony, 
German Southwest Africa, between 19&#0176; and 23&#0176; S. 
lat., 14&#0176; and 20&#0176; long. 
Moving from the Atlantic coast towards the interior the traveller meets 
first a sand-belt of forty-two miles, stripped of all vegetation and 
covered with gigantic sand-dunes; then a strip of desert land about 
ninety miles broad, with rugged, bare mountains and wide, barren 
sand-plains. Then follows Hereroland proper, which rises to a height 
of 7000 feet, and in which mountain ranges and solitary peaks succeed 
long-drawn valleys, deep ravines and high plateaux. Towards the north 
and east, this mountainous district passes over into the undulating 
plain of the Omaheke and the Kalahari Desert, which is crossed by dry 
river-beds and is sparsely inhabited. In general, the country suffers 
from want of rain; it is arid, and fit for cattle-raising only; 
agriculture is hardly possible except where the land is artificially 
irrigated. The population is composed of the Hill Damara and the Herero; 
besides these there are also some 4000 Kaffirs, Bastards, and Nama, and 
1500 Christian Ovambo. The Hill Damara, or Klip Kaffirs, about 20,000 in 
numbers, were the original possessors of the country, but were robbed of 
their pastures and flocks by the invading Herero. Down to our times they 
lived among the Herero as slaves, without rights and protection, poor and 
despised; at the uprising of the Herero they naturally sided with the German 
Government and thereby improved their lot considerably. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Herero, or 
Ovaherero, are a tribe of the Bantu, and immigrated, during the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries, from the north-east into Damaraland. Their bodies 
are well built, their skin is chocolate-coloured, their hair wavy and jet 
black. The clothing of the men consists of an apron, made of the skin of sheep 
or goats, and wound around the hips; that of the women comprises a leather cap 
with a veil, a long apron, and a hide thrown over the back; numerous rings of 
iron and pearls adorn their arms and legs, and a number of pearl strings 
encircle their necks. The Herero are boastful, vain, avaricious, beggarly, 
given to lying and cheating, dishonest, and cruel and ferocious in their 
hatred; on the other hand, they are also hospitable, possess a high sense 
of honour, and great love for their parents. Their religion consists in an 
ancestral cult, especially of the deceased chiefs of each tribe, and a 
gruesome belief in ghosts and specters, to whom they frequently offer 
sacrifices. True they recognize a God of heaven and earth, but they do 
no worship him; they think of him, but they do not thank him. Previous 
to the insurrection of 1904-1906, which almost destroyed them, they 
were divided into tribes; these were ruled by chiefs, who were at the 
same time the tribal priests. In the fights with the Nama, all the Herero 
had acknowledged one commander-in-chief, Maherero Kajamuaha. After his death, 
in 1890, the German Government chose his younger son, Samuel Maherero, 
as supreme chief, passing by the rightful heir. Generally speaking, 
monogamy prevails among the Herero, though the chiefs and the wealthier 
tribesmen often have several wives. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The acquisition of the present German 
Southwest Africa by Germany was begun in the year 1883. The Bremen merchant 
L&#0252;deritz acquired the bay of Angra Pequena and a few strips of land from 
the native chiefs; in 1884 this territory was placed under the protection of 
the German Empire. The heir to the rights of L&#0252;deritz, the German 
Colonial Company for Southwest Africa, obtained more land. As Maherero, 
the supreme chief of the Herero, had formerly sided with the English against 
the Germans, he was forced, on 21 October, 1885, to conclude a treaty of protection 
and amity with Germany, and to acknowledge the German supremacy. As this treaty 
was in many regards obscure, many quarrels arose between the German Government 
and the Herero chiefs; small uprisings were, however, easily quelled. The love of 
freedom, predominant in the Herero, numerous injustices committed by the whites, 
extortions on the part of the the white traders, and other causes finally led to 
the great insurrection of the Herero in the beginning of 1904, which soon spread 
throughout the colony. It took almost three years to subdue the sedition and great 
sacrifices of men and money had to be made. For the nation of the Herero, who 
before had numbered between 80,000 and 100,000, the revolt resulted in almost 
complete annihilation. The Herero who had been taken prisoners were accommodated 
in camps, where hundreds of them were carried off by virulent diseases. After peace 
was made, the remnant was handed over to officials, farmers, business and private 
houses, as servants. Missions in Damaraland were first begun by Protestants. Since 
1844 the Rheinidch-evangelische Missionsgesellschaft laboured in Hereroland without 
interruption. Before the insurrection it numbered 15 stations with 23 missionaries, 
46 schools with 875 boys and 1182 girls, and counted 8300 coloured Christians. The 
Fathers of the Holy Ghost were the first Catholic missionaries who, at the end of 
the seventies, made the attempt to found a mission among the Herero; owing to the 
intolerance of the Protestants, however, they were compelled to abandon the work 
in 1881 (cf. Katholische Missionen, Freiburg, 1882, pp, 107-111). It was only when 
German rule had been definitely established, that the Catholic mission was at 
liberty to work in this field. On 1 August, 1892, the Prefecture Apostolic of 
Cimbebasia Inferior was erected, and under it was placed the whole of Damaraland 
and Ovamboland; in 1896 the territory was given in charge of the German Oblates 
of Mary Immaculate. But by the Colonial Government they were forbidden to work 
among the Ovambo, Hereros, and Kaffirs, and even after they had been put on the 
same legal footing with the Protestants they still had to fight against odds. 
All obstacles were finally removed in September, 1905. The Prefecture Apostolic 
in 1908 numbered 9 stations with 22 fathers and 18 brothers (all Oblates); 10 
sisters (Franciscan Sisters from Nonnenwerth); there are 850 white, 210 blacks 
Catholics; 9 churches or chapels, 10 schools with 236 pupils, 1 trade school 
with 14 pupils, 1 high school for boys, 1 academy for girls, 1 orphan asylum, 
and 2 hospitals. <BR><BR>

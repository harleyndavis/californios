&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; German influence suddenly appeared with Carl Peters 
in 1884 and in a few months a virtual protectorate had been imposed on the south half of the 
Zanzibar mainland dominions. In 1890 a boundary was confirmed between British and German held territory 
(which remains today the border between Kenya and Tanzania).  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of islands in the Pacific north of New Guinea 
including, among many others, Yap, Truk and Ponape. Palau, administratively the most westerly 
of the group, is ethnically different. Islands first discovered by the Spanish and Portuguese in 
the 16th century and named after Charles II of Spain in 1686. Attempts in the 18th century to establish 
the Roman Catholic church there failed, but Spain maintained its claim to the group until 1875, 
when Britain protested because of its sphere of influence. Spain allowed its claim to lapse 
until the Germans occupied some of the islands in 1885. The resulting dispute was referred 
to the Pope, who awarded sovereignty to Spain, but with commercial concessions for Germany 
and Britain. The inhabitants did not accept European control and, during the 1890s, frequently 
attacked the Spanish garrison. The islands were ceded to Germany in June 1899 and the 
Spanish left in December that year.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany remained in control until invasion by Japan in October 1914. 
After the war it remained as a Japanese mandate until the end of World War II, when the group was 
handed over to the United Nations. In July 1947 the USA took over trusteeship for the UN and the 
islands achieved independence as Micronesia in 1983.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Islands were administered by the Spaniards as 
part of the Philippine Islands until they were occupied by the USA during the Spanish-American War in 
1898. The largest and most southerly island - Guam - was ceded to the USA after that and the 
remainder were occupied by the Americans until the islands were sold to Germany in 1899. They remained 
German until occupied by the Japanese in 1914, and they were then a Japanese mandate until 1944, when 
they were re-occupied by the USA. Since World War II they have been administered by the USA as a 
trusteeship territory of the United Nations. <BR>

<IMG SRC = "../graphics/de-marshall-1.gif" ALIGN = LEFT BORDER = 0 ALT= "Marshall Inseln">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Group of islands in the North Pacific, including Jaluit, 
Kwajalein, and Eniwetok. Discovered in the 17th century by the Spaniards, but not developed as 
they were too far from the Philippines, the main administrative centre. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marshall Islands became a German colony on 15 
October 1885 and administered from the capital on Jaluit. Invaded by a Japanese force 
in September 1914. Became a mandated territory under the League of Nations and a United Nations 
trusteeship territory in 1945. <BR>

<BR><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#660033"><IMG SRC="../graphics/rose.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp; New Britain</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany annexed the northern area of 
the island of New Guinea in 1884, together with islands in the Bismarck Archipelago 
(New Britain and New Ireland). In 1885 the boundaries of the Dutch, German and British 
spheres were settled. When war broke out in 1914, German New Guinea was quickly occupied 
by Imperial Forces and the whole area was placed under Australian administration in 
October 1914. At the end of the World War I German New Guinea became an Australian 
mandate under the League of Nations as the territory of New Guinea. <BR>

Apolimo, and Manono, this New Zealand mandated territory replaced German Samoa after 
its capture in 1914. In 1920 the islands were placed under New Zealand civil control.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; German merchants set up trading 
posts in 1878 at Anecho (Klein-Popo). By 1884 a protectorate 
was declared as a base for the German West African mailboats. 
During German rule there were 17 Post Offices and the last of these, Atakpam, 
was overrun by the Allies on 26 August 1914. Thereafter, the Colony was administered 
jointly by Britain and France until divided between them on 10 July 1919. 
Lome was transferred from the British area to the French on 20 September 1920. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandates were confirmed by the League 
of Nations on 20 July 1922. The United Nations awarded the British zone to the Gold 
Coast on ethnic grounds. <BR><BR>

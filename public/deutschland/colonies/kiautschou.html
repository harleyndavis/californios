&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany exercised its Imperial powers 
after the founding of the 1871 German Empire. Germany established colonies 
both in Africa and the south Pacific during the 1880s. The existence of the 
British Crown Colony of Hong Kong (from 1841-1997) on the southern coast of 
China caused Germany to look for a good Chinese harbor for its own commercial 
and military interests. Germany looked northward on the China coast. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China had been defeated by Japan in 1895 
(Sino-Japanese War). The European powers viewed China as terminally weak. The 
European powers moved on China, their policy was called, &#0147;carving up the 
Chinese melon.&#0148; The British received the New Territories around Hong Kong 
and the Russians received Port Arthur. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Germans had identified a suitable 
territory for their needs, the Bay of Chiao-chou (Kiautschou) in Shantung 
(<I>now</I>&nbsp; Shandong). 
On 1 November 1897 in a small 
fishing village then called Chingtao (now Qingdao) (Tsingtao in German), two German 
missionaries were murdered there. This gave Germany a pretext of seizing the area. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These murders were fortuitous for the 
Germans (but certainly not for the missionaries) since Germany was handed 
an excuse to seize the Kiaochou peninsula. In response to the murders, and 
since there was a strong Imperial German naval presence in the bay, Admiral 
von Diedrichs was able use his naval contingents to occupy most of the Kiaochou 
Bay area. The German ships present were the Cruiser SMS Cormoran, Cruiser SMS 
Kaiser and Cruiser SMS Prinzess Wilhelm. <BR>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1898, the Germans forced a capital of 
the concession from China and received a ninety-nine year leasehold in Shantung 
and additional extensive concessions in Shantung Province. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The colony was under the authority of the 
German Imperial Navy, not under the jurisdiction of the Reichs-Kolonial-Amt. The German authotity 
wanted to develop the protectorate into a &#0147;model 
colony&#0148; and to further commercial growth. Although there were considerable efforts 
to develop commerce, communications, finance, industry, and an educational system 
for Chinese and Europeans, the colony never realized total success. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The German administration implemented modern 
land-use laws and so was able to prevent land speculation on the Bay of Kiautschow. 
This permitted the organized planning and construction of Tsingtao, the German 
colonial city. Tsingtao, both a trading and a naval post, was divided into various 
zones: business, educational, health care, and residential. Even today the beautiful 
Germany city remains on the China coast.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ch&#0146;ing (a.k.a., Qing, Ching, or Manchu Dynasty) 
Empress Dowager, Tzu&#0146;u Hzi, was bent on the expulsion of &#0147;foreign devils&#0148; 
from her lands and used the I Ho Ch&#0145;uan (the Boxers), or &#0148;The Righteous 
and Harmonious Fists,&#0148; a religious society, for her purposes. The so 
called Boxer Rebellion was concentrated primarily in Beijing (<I>formerly</I>&nbsp; Peking), 
far from Tsingtao. The Boxers were defeated by the foreign powers and on September 7, 1901, 
the Peking Protocol was signed. In the terms of agreement which was forced on China&#0146;s 
ruling government, the foreign nations received very favorable commercial treaties, 
foreign troops would be permanently stationed in Peking, and China would be forced 
to pay an equivalent of $333 million dollars as penalty for the rebellion. Still, 
Chinese nationalism continued to grow. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China&#0146;s regional Governors Generals ignored the 
Empress Dowager&#0146;s instructions against the foreigners and attempted to prevent disorder 
or any harm coming to their &#0147;guests.&#0148; <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1911, an uprising began in the western province 
of Szechwan. That uprising expanded into a full blown national revolution which ended 
imperial rule in China. In 1913, Dr. Sun Yat-sen and his party, the Kuomintang, won the national 
election. To preserve national unity, Sun relinquished the presidency on April 1, 1912, 
to the military strongman, Yuan Shih-k&#0146;ai, who declared himself emperor in 1915. China 
was still in turmoil. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was against this backdrop of internal disorder 
that the German authorities needed to function. The ultimate failure of Kiautschow was 
not however caused by the internal problems of China. It was caused by Germany&#0146;s 
participation in World War I. 
Tsingtao came under Japanese and British siege in August, 1914. After a siege lasting 
over ten weeks, 
Tsingtao fell on 7 November 1914. In a practical sense, German colonial rule in China 
ended with the 
transport of German soldiers to Japan as prisoners of war. Officially, it was the 
Treaty of Versailles that ended the protectorate on paper; (Art. 128 &#0147;Germany 
renounces in favor of China all benefits and privileges resulting from the provisions 
of the final Protocol signed at Peking in 1901&#0148;). Tsingtao lived under Japan&#0146;s 
colonial rule until 1922. <BR><BR>

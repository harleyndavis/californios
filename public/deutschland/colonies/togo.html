During the 1840s, the first German missionaries and German merchants arrived in Togoland. 
The merchants bought palm products and by 1878, set up trading posts in 1878 at 
Anecho (Klein-Popo). In 1884, Gustav Nachtigal signed treaties with 
several coastal headmen and in that year the Germans sought protectorate status since they 
needed a base for their German West African mailboats. The German protectorate over South Togoland was recognized 
by the Conference of Berlin (1884-85). German military expeditions gained control of 
North Togoland during the 1890s, and the protectorate&#0146;s boundaries were further refined 
in treaties with France (1897) and Great Britain (1904). Germany instituted much economic 
development, building roads and railroads, constructing a good port at Lom&#0233;. The production 
of palm products, rubber, cotton, and cacao was encouraged. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
However, German levies of direct taxes and forced labor aroused resentment 
among the Togolese. In Aug 1914, British and French forces invaded Togoland. 
Atakpam was overrun by the Allies on 26 August 1914. Thus came the first Allied 
victory of World War I. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Colony was administered 
jointly by Britain and France until divided between them on 10 July 1919. 
Lom&#0233; was transferred from the British area to the French on 20 September 1920. 
On 20 July 1922, the League of Nations divided the region into two mandates, 
one French and the other British, and in 1946 the mandates became trust 
territories of the United Nations. French Togoland was administered as a 
separate unit until 1960 when it became 
independent as the Republic of Togo. British Togoland, made up of West Togoland, 
was administered as part of the British Gold Coast colony and protectorate and 
in 1957 became part of the independent state of Ghana. </DIV><BR><BR>

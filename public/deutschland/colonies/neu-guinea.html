In 1884, Imperial Germany annexed the northeastern area of the island of New Guinea, along 
with islands of New Britain and New Ireland in the Bismarck Archipelago. 

The eastern half of the island of New Guinea  was divided between Germany (north) and the Great Britian  (south) in 1885. 
The British held southern area of New Guinea was transferred to Australia in 1902. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Germany developed plantation railways, and 
with shipping links to the NDL (Norddeutscher Lloyd) steamships, were able to ship large quantities of copra
to Europe. <BR><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#000099">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#0147;The companies 
began to make profits and individuals 
were encouraged to become planters. 
Land for plantations was purchased from 
villagers and confirmed as freehold 
title by the administration. It was 
widely believed that the welfare of the 
local people could best be promoted in 
European-managed enterprises. The Germans 
demanded strict discipline by labourers 
and any breach led to punishment such as 
caning. Medical services and schools were 
established for the local population. 
Through the provision of these social services, 
it was hoped to &#0145;coax the natives into 
becoming part of this expanding economic 
empire.&#0146; &#0148; </FONT><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
At the start of World War I in 1914, Germany lost control of German New Guinea.  
On 11 September 1914, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force 
landed at Rabaul and Herbertsh&#0246;he, 
On 17 September a surrender was signed. Rabaul is located on the island of New 
Britian, so called  Neu Pommern by the Germans. The whole area 
was placed under Australian administration in October 1914. At the end of 
the World War I, German New Guinea became an Australian mandate under the 
League of Nations as the territory of New Guinea. Once know as 
Kaiser Wilhelmland, German New Guinea is now part of Papua New Guinea.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#0147;The second oldest German colony is German New Guinea which, 
geographically, only applies to Kaiser Wilhelm&#0146;s Land - the north-east 
portion of the island of New Guinea or Papua. Administratively it also 
comprises the Bismarck Archipelago (including some of the Solomon Islands), 
the Caroline Islands, the Marianne Islands, and the Marshall Islands. The 
name German New Guinea is certainly somewhat of a misnomer, the more so as 
the seat of Government is situated at Herbertsh&#0246;he, on Gazelle Island in the 
Bismarck Archipelago. It was at one time decided that the name of the colony 
should be altered to German Australia - a much more fitting description - but 
the change was never made. The three last groups have been supplied with their 
own series of stamps, so these will be discussed separately, and this article 
will only deal with the two first divisions. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#0147;New Guinea, or Papua, is after Australia the largest island in the world, 
and is separated from the Australian continent by the shallow island-studded 
Torres Straits, 80 to 90 miles wide at its narrowest part. The two regions at 
one time formed continuous land, and an upheaval of less than sixty fathoms 
would agaln unite them, though elsewhere the mainland is washed by deep waters 
ranging from 500 to 1300 fathoms. The island appears to have been first sighted 
by D&#0146;Abreu in 1511 but it was some years later when the first Europeans 
visited it. In 1526, a Portuguese commander, Don Jorge de Meneses, accidentally 
over-ran his distance in voyaging from Malacca to Ternate and found himself at 
New Guinea. It was visited by other Portuguese and Spanish traders in later years 
and one of these, Retez (Roda) gave it its present name of New Guinea on account 
of the resemblance of its inhabitants to those of the Guinea coast. In 1601 Luis 
Vaz de Torres passed through the straits which still bear his name, and sailed along 
the south coast of the island taking possession in the name of the King of Spain. In 
the same year the Dutch began their settlements in the west, and for more than two 
centuries afterwards practically all explorations in New Guinea were conducted by 
this nation. In 1700, Dampier, an Englishman, sailed along the north coast surveying 
and naming many points. In 1793, the East India Company occupied the island of Manassari 
in Geelvink Bay and in 1828 the western half of the island was placed under Dutch protection. 
Twenty years later the Dutch proclaimed their sovereignty over the portion under their 
protection and fixed the boundary line at 141 0 east longitude and this meridian was 
accordingly taken as the western boundary when England and Germany proclaimed spheres 
of influence in 1884. Protectorates were almost immediately declared by these two 
countries over the southeast and northeast portions respectively, and various 
conventions in later years fixed approximate boundaries. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#0147;While the coasts have been fairly well surveyed the interior of New Guinea 
is still practically an unknown land and the few expeditions that have 
attempted to open up the German portion have found progress exceedingly 
difficult. There are no paths, the territory is terribly rugged and covered 
with a dense undergrowth, and the whole country is covered with thick, dank 
forest. Timber valuable for cabinet-making purposes is plentiful but difficult 
to obtain. The climate is trying to Europeans on account of the heat combined 
with intense humidity. There are many rivers one of which, the Kaiserin Augusta, 
has been ascended by sea-going steamers for a distance of about two hundred miles. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#0147;The colony is directly administered by the Imperial Government but the development 
of its resources is in the the hands of the German New Guinea Company which was 
granted an Imperial charter on May 17th, 1885. The Company has sovereign rights; 
no arms or spirits are allowed to be sold, and labor traffic (for years a vexed 
question in these parts) is forbidden except for German plantations. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The country is famed for its birds of Paradise which exist in many varieties, and 
gorgeous parrots, cockatoos, and pigeons are also found in abundance. Its fauna is 
closely related to that of Australia and includes more than thirty species of 
marsupials (such as the kangaroo). <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#0147;The population numbers over 100,000 natives and these seem to combine at least 
four ethnical elements: Papuan proper, diffused over the whole region; Negrito; 
Eastern Polynesian; and Malay. Through the mingling of these elements small tribal 
groups speak a surprising number of distinct languages. Cannibalism is very prevalent; 
some tribes are predatory; but many others are peaceful, industrious and keen traders, 
displaying remarkable skill in the arts of pottery, wood-carving and husbandry. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#0147;In November, 1884, a German protectorate was declared over the New Britain Archipelago 
and several adjacent groups of islands. Later a portion of the Solomon Islands, including 
Bougainville and Buka, the two largest, were included in the protectorate and the whole 
group was then re-named the Bismarck Archipelago. Though under direct Imperial 
administration this territory is also developed by the German New Guinea Company, 
its charter being extended in December, 1886, to include the northern group of the 
Solomon Islands. New Hanover has an area of 570 square miles; New Mecklenburg has 
an area of 4,900 square miles, and New Britain or New Pommern has an area of 9,600 
square miles. This latter and the small islands of the Lauenburg group are the only 
well explored districts. Here there are several successful plantations producing copra, 
coffee, cotton and rubber. The chief settlements are Matupi, a small island in Blanche 
Bay entirely occupied by a trading concern and Herbertsh&#0246;he, the seat of Government. 
New Pommern offers greater facilities to European settlers than any of the other 
islands many of which, though considerable in size are almost unapproachable, and 
man is almost wilder than nature. The natives are all very war-like and most of 
them are confirmed cannibals, and they offer the most strenuous opposition to all 
attempts at European ingress. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#0147;Bougainville, in the Solomon Islands, named after one of its discoverers, is 
exceedingly mountainous and has an extraordinarily heavy annual rainfall. Here also 
little progress has been made on account of unhealthiness of the climate for 
Europeans and the natural savagery of the native tribes.&#0148; </FONT><BR>

<I><B>DATELINE</B></I></FONT> On 20 June 2005. <BR>
<DD> The USGWPDPCPC (USGenWeb-Discuss Political Correctness 
Police Chief) has resigned from her mailing list inquisitor duties &#0147;in the best 
interests of the USGenWeb Project,&#0148; so, as it 
would seem, she could continue her roll of USGWPECPC (USGenWeb Project Election 
Committee Police Commandant) and be able to perpetuate the illusion that the EC 
(Election Committee) is free of taint. But is it? Stay tuned. 
<BR><BR>
<HR COLOR="#FF0000"> <BR>

<DD>&#0147;The thought police would get him just the same. 
He had committed---would have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper---the 
essential crime that contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime, they called it. 
Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge 
successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they
were bound to get you.&#0148;</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#A4D3EE">-- 1984,

<DD>The USGenWeb Project&#0146;s leaders claim that they have the right to use 
their selected <I>The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure, 4th Edition</I> 
by Alice Sturgis as a source for their additional authority that fills the gap 
for rules not included in the USGenWeb Project Bylaws. <BR>

<DD>Whether or not their amateur parliamentarian, Roger Swafford is correct 
in his interpretation of <I>Strugis</I> is not the question here. The real 
question is whether the USGenWeb Project National Coordinator and Advisory 
Board fairly follow the spirit of <I>Strugis</I> and evenhandedly apply 
ALL parts of of <I>Sturgis</I> for the benifit of the members -- or do they 
selectively pick just certain items from <I>Sturgis</I> and pretend that 
the rest of the book does not exist. Does the National Coordinator and Advisory 
Board misuse <I>Sturgis</I> to the detriment of the members? <BR><BR>

The Right of Discussion
<DD>Full and free discussion of every proposition presented for decision is an
established right of members. Each member of the assembly has the right to
speak freely without interruption or interference provided that the rules
are observed. The right of members to &#0147;have their say,&#0148; or to &#0147;have their
day in court,&#0148; is as important as their right to vote. ... <BR>

&#0147;Fairness and Good Faith
<DD>All meetings must be characterized by fairness and by good faith.
Trickery, overemphasis on minor technicalities, dilatory tactics, indulgence
in personalities, and railroading threaten the spirit practice of fairness
and good faith. If a meeting is characterized by fairness and good faith, a
minor procedural error will invalidate an action that has been taken by an
organization. But fraud, unfairness, or absence of good faith may cause a
court to hold any action invalid.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<DD>The USGenWeb Project leaders conveniently overlook calling meetings, as provided 
in <I>Sturgis</I>. USGenWeb-Discuss is the official discussion list of The 
USGenWeb Project. It is the only place provided for the Project membership 
to assemble. At our ONLY meeting place - fear of reprisal runs rampant.
It is well known that list owners and list administrators have the right to 
establish reasonable standards and maintain decorum. Tina Vickery is the appointed list 
administrator. She then is the agent for the Project leaders. <BR>
<DD>Ms. Vickery over-moderates, bans, and more importantly, she stifles free speech and 
negates the spirit of <I>Sturgis</I>. She has a whole vocabulary of words that have 
caused her retribution, words like Anal Retentive, Analogies, Asinine, Garbage, King, 
Law suit, Rubbish, Rat&#0146;s Patootie, ~tngiles, and Sez. Ms. Vickery certainly kills the 
members rights to speak without fear of reprisal. And all this with the NC/AB's 
blessing. <BR>

<DD>Ahh, but the worst is yet to come. Read the list rules (just below) imposed by Ms. Vickery. 
Notice how she bans discussion on any important issues that might affect the Project. BTW, 
it is OK to do anagrams on USGENWEB-DISCUSS. Yes, that&#0146;s right, anagrams. <BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFA500" SIZE="+2">List Rules of the USGenWeb-Discuss Mail List</FONT> <BR>
</DIV> <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Added 4 November 2004 <BR>
Discussion of personnel matters inclusive of mediation and hearings is prohibited. This is
inclusive of forwarding e-mail and/or urls [contained in subject lines, body of message and/or use in tag
lines] that acknowledge in any way USGenWeb Project personnel matters is prohibited on the USGENWEB-
DISCUSS list. The penalty for doing so will be immediate un-subscription. <BR><BR>

The Rest of the Story <BR>
I welcome respectful, constructive, appropriate discussion of all
topics regarding the USGenWeb Project, political or otherwise. No
flaming is allowed. I require that all topics be handled with courtesy
and respect. This list may not only answer a question that you may
been struggling with, share a resource that will be beneficial to all,
but serve as a tool for us all to work together. <BR><BR>
This list *IS NOT* the place for discussion of lawsuits (pending or
otherwise), innuendoes or threats (against people, places, animals, or
things), nor is it a place for discussion of the penal code, and most
certainly not the place for offers of contributions to a legal defense
fund. If any subscriber engages in these topics and/or analogies, they
will be moderated for one week. Period end of story. <BR><BR>  

There have been legitimate concerns raised by many of you that you can
not reply properly to concerns of the USGenWeb Project without quoting
posts from BOARD-L within your comments.  So I will allow it. BOARD-L
is a public, archived list. <BR><BR>

I do, however, encourage each of you to quote fully with your replies,
as it will best provide other list members the full context of what
you are articulating and what it is in response to.   I believe that is
fair. <BR><BR>

I very much want the discussions to be constructive, productive, and
beneficial to the USGenWeb Project community. <BR><BR>

I will place on moderated status any member of this list who does not
post with the above rules in mind. After a period of one week you
shall be un-moderated by me. If the behavior continues, you will be
unsubscribed from the USGENWEB-DISCUSS list. I am quite serious about
this -- Consider yourselves warned. <BR><BR>

Sincerely, <BR>
Tina Vickery <BR><BR> </BLOCKQUOTE>

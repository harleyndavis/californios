I suppose that if we wanted to take a broad look at things, we might say that when early humans exited Africa, they had their cerebral suitcases packed full of symbols. After all, besides the good luck of finding some animal carcass, they had sun, moon, stars, spirals, circles, rays, etc.; those items were and are great source of symbols.

But were those cave dudes the creators of the symbols?

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The steam schooner -- a wooden-hulled steamer designed for the coastal lumber trade -- is 
unique to the West Coast. The <I>Wapama</I> is the last of 235 steam schooners built  on that Coast. 
She was built in 1915 for the run between Oregon and California.  The long shallow hulls of the steam schooners 
made for a weak structure, prone to sag at the bow  and stern. As age and decay sapped the strength of the 
<I>Wapama&#0146;s</I> massive  timbers  this &#0147hogging&#0148 process became so bad that she could not remain 
afloat.  Placed on a barge in 1980 the <I>Wapama</I> remains a unique and impressive piece  of naval 
architecture. Given suitable systems for rot control, physical support and  weather protection, 
it will be possible to preserve the ship indefinitely out of  the water.   <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This painting 
was done while the <I>Wapama</I> was in the historic Oakland estuary, Oakland, California.  
In the distance behind the ship are the buildings of the U. S. Coast Guard base  at Alameda. 
Currently, the <I>Wapama</I> is located in Richmond California.  <BR><BR>

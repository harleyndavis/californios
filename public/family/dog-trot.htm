&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A common early rural domestic building style was a single room log house, or pen as 
the architects call it. Often the attic was used as a sleeping loft. As the family grew, a 
second log house would be built adjacent to the first. The two buildings, or double pens, 
could be joined by a common roof and a wood floor between the buildings could 
added. The space created between the two buildings is called a dogtrot. This breezeway 
of sorts would, in winter, allow the dogs to get in, out of the rain and snow, or in the 
summertime, let them find some shade. A dear cousin tells me of being able to hear the 
click of the dog&#0146s toe nails as they went through the dogtrot. In latter years, many 
dogtrots were enclosed and siding was added to disguise the building&#0146s humble 
origins. 
Even today, there are in the south, many modern buildings with simple log houses at 
their core.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the single pen log houses that I have measured, 20' x 20' square is the usual 
measurement. Put two pens together with a 10' space between them, add the common 
roof and you have the dogtrot cabin.<BR><BR>
Kitchen Additions. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, each of the two pens of a dogtrot house would have a fireplace. 
The fireplaces would heat the pens in the winter and one of fireplaces at least would be used 
for cooking. While cooking in the fireplace might seem practical in the winter, cooking in the 
hot and humid summertime of the American southeast could prove highly uncomfortable. Odors and 
smoke would only make matters worse. Kitchens could be added directly to the dogtrot or built as 
totally separate out buildings. While the threat of fire may have been part of the reasoning for 
building totally separate kitchens, many kitchens were attached to existing dogtrot houses. <BR><BR>

Tennessee in 1992. To see photos of another dogtrot with modifications, please see

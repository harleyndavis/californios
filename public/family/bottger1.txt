Les, thank you for your quick answer.
I will be sending the copies to you per mail later on today.
 
So you can "copy and paste" if needed, I am sending the
report as an attachment.
 
Have fun getting the names Temple Ready.
Liebe Gruesse,

Germany Field Trip-Eisenach Archive
                                                            February 2011
 
            I had hoped at first that the records for Neustadt, an der Orla, would be available on micro film yet, but they had misunderstood me when I called. The original books are collected and have been packed in the Archive collection room and will be send for microfilming within the next 2 month. They expect them to be back in microfilm form before the end of the year. If I should go back to Germany next year, I will check on the status of the filming and if they are available I will research and complete the RECHNER line. 
            Since I was at the Eisenach Archive and could not do the RECHNER line, I decided to spend some time on the "BOETTGER and collateral lines", going back further in time, in the parish Koenigsee. You know by now how to enter everything into New Family Search and will be soon an expert in doing so. (I still don't like this new system, but my husband is very excited about it). Following you will find the result of this research session:

Husband: Johann Nicol THIERSFELDER (is already in your PAF file)
he was a widower at the time of this marriage
second marriage: 7 Nov 1776 in Koenigsee, document # 19
Second wife: Barbara Elisabeth HANEISEN (was misspelled before, please correct it)
daughter of Hans Wolfgang HANEISEN of Oberhan
Two children were born to this second marriage, since he must have been quite a bit older:
I.          Maria Elisabeth                      *  1 June 1777
ii.         Johann Adam                           *  1 Sep 1779
First Wife: Anna Rosina Dorothea, surname not known
died: 10 Apr 1776 in Koenigsee, age 67 years, 3 month, 6 days, born about 1709, doc. # 18
So far I have not found the first marriage, nor did I find children born to the first marriage, however, looking at the wife's age at the time of death, they probably had grown up children by the time he married the second time and could have been married by 1725 or so.
Husband: Christian Friedrich BOETTGER, (is already in your PAF file)
son of Johann Nicol BOETTGER
born: 2 Mar 1779 in Koenigsee

Dear Les, 
I have performed ½ day of research for you in the Eisenach Archive.
At this time you owe me:
½ day research at the Eisenach Archive         $ 300.00
19 copies at 50 cents each                               $      9.50
The total comes to   $ 309.50, 
 which I trust you will send me in the near future.
Have fun entering the names into Family Search and preparing it for Temple Work.
Have a wonderful day,
Marion

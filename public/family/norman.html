of Felix Grundy Norman, Sr., 1808-1885</B><BR><BR><DD>
<FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ELIX</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+2">G.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">ORMAN</FONT>, of Franklin 
[County Alabama], was born and educated in Tennessee. He represented Franklin for the first time 
at the session of 1841, and by continuous elections,  he served in the House until the close of the session of 
1847-8, since which time he has been in private life, engaged in the practice of law. While in the Legislature, 
Col. Norman was a very efficient member, both in debate and in Committees. He was a Democrat from honest conviction, 
and never departed from that faith, but always kept himself in the path of duty according to the best of his judgment. 
Acting on principle, he opposed at every step the resolutions of the General Assembly accepting Alabama&#0146;s portion 
of the proceeds of the public lands. In the same manner, he opposed what he considered the improper identity in the 
same resolution, on the Constitutional amendment providing for biennial sessions of  the Legislature, and for the 
removal of the Seat of Government at the session  of 1845. In all this, he only yielded to a sense of duty, to 
prevent injustice, or an unsafe precedent. However laudable his purpose, he course on the question of removal 
resulted to his injury, through influences subsequently brought to bear against him, in a political sense. <BR>


<DD>For many years, Col. Norman was Grand High Priest and Grand Master of the Masonic fraternity of Alabama, 
who presented him, on his retirement, appropriate medals, commemorating his services to the craft. <BR>  

<DD>From his bearing in the Legislature, the courtesy he always exhibited in debate, the intelligence with which 
he handled questions, and the ease and graceful elocution which seemed natural to him, Col. Norman was unquestionably 
cast in a large intellectual mould, capable of expansion beyond the limits within which it was  his fortune to be 
confined as a political aspirant. Although rigid in the tenets of his party, and at times somewhat acrimonious under 
provocation, he was not blind to the merits of a measure because it may have originated with his opponents. He was 
bold and fearless, often displaying the gallantry of ancient knighthood in the legislative arena, shivering a lance 
with friend or foe without personal malice. His face was luminous with good feeling, and his whole deportment was 
that of a gentleman sensible of the rights of others, and careful of his own, in all that relates to the substantial 
etiquette of life. Had his lot permitted a more congenial opening for the development of his character after the 
inward model, there is no doubt that Col. Norman would have filled a large space before the public, and achieved 
a reputation as proudly National as that which he now enjoys is, in local view, distinguished  for ability and honor. 
Perhaps the greatest obstacle to his advancement to higher places has been a certain measure of self-respect and 
honorable sensibility, which made intrigue and management the usual medium of success repugnant to his nature. He 
has abundant  reason, however to be satisfied with the result, in his own high and unimpeachable  character. He is 
still in the meridian of life, and he resides in Tuscumbia.

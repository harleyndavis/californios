<div align="justify">Welcome friend, <br>
<dd>We live in a small condominium at the <i>south</i> end of Sausalito (now 
called Old Town) and in that area affectionally known as <i>Hurricane Gulch</i>. 
Our front yard is an elevated deck with pots of cactus and other succulents and 
with our grand view of Shelter Cove (<i>aka</i> Whalers' Cove, Old Town Cove) 
Richardson's Bay, and Angel Island, but if we want to really be outside, it's 
Sausalito, Fort Baker, the Golden Gate, and the Headlands.   <br><br>

About our Sausalito Photographic Slideshows,<br>
<dd>There are thirty slides in each slideshow and many different slideshows of 
Sausalito. Below each slideshow are thirty thumbnail images, one for each slide. 
You may need to scroll down to see all the thumbnails.
<br>
<dd>The slideshows are not surveys of all restaurants, galleries and other 
businesses in town. We have taken almost all of photographs. There is one 
photograph taken by <a href="http://www.johnwilmer.com/">John Wilmer</a>, his 
photograph is of the late Phil Frank. Phil Frank is best known for his cartoons of 
Farley and Farley's menagerie of feathered and furry friends. Phil Frank's image, 
complete with his <i>E Clampus Vitus</i> attire, appears in <a 
href="show2.html">Slideshow 2</a>. <br>
<dd>The slideshow content is not organized by subject or date, almost all 
slideshows are in random order. The exceptions are <a href="show6.html">Slideshow 
6</a> which presents sample views of the Sausalito Art Festival, Labor Day 
Weekend, 2008, <a href="show8.html">Slideshow 8</a> which shows ten 2008 Chili 
Cook Off images, and <a href="show10.html">Slideshow 10</a> which shows a number 
of <i>Maltese Falcon</i> and <i>Angel Island Fire</i> 2008 images.
<br>
<dd>Please note that the photographs only cover subjects within Sausalito's City 
Limits and a small portion of an unincorporated area of Marin County just past the 
northern tip of Sausalito itself, the Waldo Point Harbor area and its floating 
homes.  <br><br>
Copyright, Privacy, Access, and Such <br>
<dd>Some proprietors of galleries, jewelry stores, etc. do <i>not allow</i> 
photography inside their stores. That is because most if not all of the artwork 
and jeweler is copyrighted by the artists and designers. Unless we have specific 
permission from those proprietors to photograph inside, we take our photographs 
from the outside. <br>
<dd>A few docks are closed to public access but most are open. Our floating homes 
are not only private property but are year round homes for some folk. Please 
respect the privacy of our <i>floating residents</i>. <br>
<dd>There is one beautiful area of Sausalito that is west of U.S. 101. It is one 
best locations in Marin County with spectacular views of the San Francisco Bay and 
the Marin Headlands. It is Wolfback Ridge. Reachable by vehicle only from Wolfback 
Ridge Road <i>(formerly named Spencer and West Spencer)</i>. ALL public access is 
denied, not even hiking or bicycling is allowed. <br><br>
About Sausalito (Saucelito) <br>


<dd><a href="http://www.co.marin.ca.us/depts/lb/main/crm/maps/sausalito.html">
Saucelito Rancho</a> started as an 1838 Mexican land grant to William
(Guillermo Antonio) Richardson. Even before California's Gold Rush in 1848,
the ships of the Yankee traders and New Bedford whalers would take on fresh
water from the willow springs at Shelter Cove (<i>aka,</i> Whalers' Cove),
now known as Old Town. <br>

<dd>From a distance, Sausalito watched San Francisco grow and
flourish as gold poured in from California's Mother Lode and silver poured
in from Nevada's Comstock Lode. While San Francisco became a city of great
wealth, Sausalito could only look on from the narrow mudflats along
Richardson's Bay and from the lower piedmont of Marin County's Wolfback
Ridge. Sausalito became a tiny blue collar town providing service to sailing
ships, in time, some small boat building devolved, it became a ferryboat
terminal and in the 1870s, the southern terminus of the narrow gauge North
Pacific Coast Railroad. That railroad brought redwood lumber, local dairy
and agricultural products from southwest Sonoma County and northwest Marin
to Sausalito's ferry landing. There the small narrow gauge freight cars were
loaded onto the boats and taken to San Francisco where they were offloaded.
Portuguese boat builders mostly from Portuguese  Azores, Italian fishermen,
Chinese shopkeepers (the little Yee Tock Chee Park is named for one very
popular and kindly Chinese shopkeeper), railroad workers, ferryboat crewmen, and 
nearby
Portuguese dairy ranchers all are part of Sausalito's working class heritage.<br>

<dd>Asides from the blue collar workers, there was also the money class
commuters like the San Francisco and English businessmen who would ferry to
Sausalito then go to their upscale homes, summer houses, and hillside
estates, located on The Hill (a local British colony of sorts above the
current downtown historic business district).<br>

<dd>In 1904, the narrow gauge North Pacific Coast Railroad became the North Shore
Railroad and in 1907 became the Northwestern Pacific Railroad. Through all
the changes, Sausalito remained a transportation hub.<br>

<dd>On the seamy side, during federal Prohibition, Sausalito had more than
its fair share of rumrunners, speakeasies, and backyard stills.<br>

<dd>The Golden Gate Bridge was completed in 1937. The bridge guaranteed the end
of the railroad and ferryboat hub. The north end of the bridge, a new
highway was completed on the uphill side of populated Sausalito. Sausalito was 
bypassed.
Ferryboat service from San Francisco to Marin County was on a considerable decline 
and
ended February 28, 1941. Ferryboats were retired and some were abandoned along
Sausalito's northern mudflats and became homes for starving artists. <i>(In 1970, 
a new
<a href="http://goldengateferry.org/schedules/">ferryboat service</A> was 
inaugurated by the Golden Gate Bridge,
Highway and Transportation District. The Blue and Gold Fleet also provides
<a href="http://www.blueandgoldfleet.com/Ferry/">ferryboat service</A>.)</i> <br>

<dd>Sausalito didn't get much time to sleep though, WW II brought a new
round of nautical excitement to town. The mudflats of Sausalito's northern
shore along Richardson's Bay were quickly converted to <i>Marinship</i> and
construction liberty ships was soon started. In 3&#0189; years Marinship produced 
93 ships for
the war effort. When WW II was over, Marinship was closed and the Sausalito 
waterfront
went back to sleep. <br>
<dd>
<dd>Marinship during WW II had brought in many workers who taxed the limited
available housing supply. For some, life on the water was the answer. Makeshift
floating homes built on old boats and barges became common.  After the war,
some stayed and returning veterans settled the waterfront and they too
adopted the laid-back life. This idyllic location with its undemanding
lifestyle also attracted more of the artistic inclined, the <i>bohemian
style</i> beatniks of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s fit right in.
By the 1970s, the artists' refuge turned into an artist community and was
in full flourish along the waterfront.<br>

<dd>The Sausalito Art Festival was first held at Shell Beach (now the site
of the Spinnaker Restaurant). Since then, it has moved, changed management,
and grown into a world class event. It is currently held at Marinship Park
every Labor Day Weekend.
<dd>
Its upper class homes
are increasing. Today, Sausalito is a favorite with tourists, ferry-boaters from 
San Francisco, and
weekend bicyclists. The "tourist season" runs from March through October. <br>
<dd>Automobiles and bicycles compete over road space, especially at the south end 
of town where the
two lane road is extremely narrow. The bicyclists come down the hill through Fort 
Baker and enter
south Sausalito only to find themselves in a very precarious situation. Some of 
the
bicyclists are young children who are inexperienced bike riders. If you enter 
Sausalito by automobile, be
alert and please use caution.

<br><br>

Sausalito, Metes and Bounds<br>
<dd>Sausalito's dwellings, great and small, cling to a narrow band of real estate 
"clamping themselves thereto like limpets to a rock." Sausalito is bounded on most 
sides by neighbors who have their own property rights. Expansion of Sausalito is 
not practical. The U.S. 101 freeway and Golden Gate National Recreation Area keeps 
Sausalito from expanding westward; Fort Baker, also in the G.G.N.R.A., prohibits 
southward expansion. To the north, only that small area called Waldo Point Harbor 
(Gate 6 and Gate 6&#0189; Roads) could realistically be annexed, however that 
property is already developed.  The commercial real estate developers therefore 
cast an eager eye to Sausalito's eastern shore and the tidal waters of 
Richardson's Bay.
<br>
<dd>Home builders need to look to a few remaining unbuilt lots (usually on steep 
hillsides) and are often required to perform extraordinary foundation work before 
a new home can be built. The remove of older homes and replacing them with new 
homes is another option. <br>
<dd>Sausalito can be pricey, you can pay more but get less square footage. It is 
full of tourists much of the year. The question then is, <i>Why would anyone want 
to live here?</i> The answer is simple, high quality of life and <i>location, 
location, location.</i>

<br><br>
About the Weather, <br>
<dd>During the summertime, the hot temperatures of California's Central Valley 
cause the air to rise and the fog to be pulled in through the Golden Gate. San 
Francisco's two Pacific facing Districts, the Richmond and Sunset can be blanketed 
with fog and Fort Point at the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge can be 
downright uncomfortably windy. The Marin side of the bridge can also receive its 
fair share of fog and wind, and Sausalito, especially the Old Town area, can be 
subjected to the same winds. Folk expecting summer weather in August are sometimes 
surprised at very cool days. Layered clothing is a good choice. <i>Northern</i> 
Sausalito can be warmer than the <i>southern</i> area, the <i>northern</i> area is 
referred to as a "Banana Belt."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me that there never was a more peaceful or 
happy people on the face of the earth than the Spanish, Mexican, and Indian 
population of Alta California before the American conquest. We were the 
pioneers of the Pacific coast, building towns and Missions while General 
Washington was carrying on the war of the Revolution, and we often talk 
together of the days when a few hundred large Spanish ranches and Mission 
tracts occupied the whole country from the Pacific to the San Joaquin. No class of 
American citizens is more loyal than the Spanish Californians, but we shall 
always be especially proud of the traditions and memories of the long pastoral 
age before 1840. Indeed, our social life still tends to keep alive a spirit of love for 
the simple, homely, outdoor life of our Spanish ancestors on this coast, and we 
try, as best we may, to honor the founders of our ancient families, and the saints 
and heroes of our history since the days when Father Junipero planted the cross 
at Monterey. The leading features of old Spanish life at the Missions, and on the 
large ranches of the last century, have been described in many books of travel, 
and with many contradictions. I shall confine myself to those details and 
illustrations of the past that no modern writer can possibly obtain except 
vaguely, from hearsay, since they exist in no manuscript, but only in the 
memories of a generation that is fast passing away. My mother has told me 
much, and I am still more indebted to my illustrious uncle, General Vallejo, of 
Sonoma, many of whose recollections are incorporated in this article.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a child there were fewer than 
fifty Spanish families in the region about the bay of San Francisco, and these 
were closely connected by ties of blood or intermarriage. My father and his 
brother, the late General Vallejo, saw, and were a part of, the most important 
events in the history of Spanish California, the revolution and the conquest. My 
grandfather, Don Ygnacio Vallejo, was equally prominent in his day, in the 
exploration and settlement of the province. The traditions and records of the 
family thus cover the entire period of the annals of early California, from San 
Diego to Sonoma.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I wish to do is to tell, as plainly and 
carefully as possible, how the Spanish settlers lived, and what they did in the old 
days. The story will be partly about the Missions, and partly about the great 
ranches.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jesuit Missions established in Lower 
California, at Loreto and other places, were followed by Franciscan Missions in 
Alta California, with presidios for the soldiers, adjacent pueblos, or towns, and 
the granting of large tracts of land to settlers. By 1782 there were nine flourishing 
Missions in Alta California - San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Carlos, San 
Antonio, San Luis Obispo, San Buenaventura, San Gabriel, San Juan, and San 
Diego. Governor Faj&#0233;s added Santa Barbara and Purissima, and by 1790 
there were more than 7000 Indian converts in the various Missions. By 1800 
about forty Franciscan fathers were at work in Alta California, six of whom had 
been among the pioneers of twenty and twenty-five years before, and they had 
established seven new Missions - San Jos&#0233;, San Miguel, Soledad, San 
Fernando, Santa Cruz, San Juan Bautista, and San Luis Rey. The statistics of all 
the Missions, so far as they have been preserved, have been printed in various 
histories, and the account of their growth, prosperity, and decadence has often 
been told. All that I wish to point out is that at the beginning of the century the 
whole system was completely established in Alta California. In 1773 Father Palou 
had reported that all the Missions, taken together, owned two hundred and four 
head of cattle and a few sheep, goats, and mules. In 1776 the regular five 
years&#0146; supplies sent from Mexico to the Missions were as follows: 107 
blankets, 480 yards striped sackcloth, 389 yards blue baize, 10 pounds blue 
maguey cloth, 4 reams paper, 5 bales red pepper, 10 arrobas of tasajo (dried 
beef), beads, chocolate, lard, lentils, rice, flour, and four barrels of Castilian wine. 
By 1800 all this was changed: the flocks and herds of cattle of California 
contained 187,000 animals, of which 153,000 were in the Mission pastures, and 
large areas of land had been brought under cultivation, so that the Missions 
supplied the presidios and foreign ships.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one need suppose that the Spanish 
pioneers of California suffered many hardships or privations, although it was a 
new country. They came slowly, and were well prepared to become settlers. All 
that was necessary for the maintenance and enjoyment of life according to the 
simple and healthful standards of those days was brought; with them. They had 
seeds, trees, vines, cattle, household goods, and servants, and in a few years their 
orchards yielded abundantly and their gardens were full of vegetables. Poultry 
was raised by the Indians, and sold very cheaply; a fat capon cost only twelve 
and a half cents. Beef and mutton were to be had for the killing, and wild game 
was very abundant. At many of the Missions there were large flocks of tame 
pigeons. At the Mission San Jos&#0233; the fathers&#0146; doves consumed a 
cental of wheat daily, besides what they gathered in the village. The doves were 
of many colors, and they made a beautiful appearance on the red tiles of the 
church and the tops of the dark garden walls.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The houses of the Spanish people were built 
of adobe, and were roofed with red tiles. They were very comfortable, cool in 
summer and warm in winter. The clay used to make the bricks was dark brown, 
not white or yellow, as the adobes in the Rio Grande region and in part of 
Mexico. Cut straw was mixed with the clay, and trodden together by the Indians. 
When the bricks were laid, they were set in clay as mortar, and sometimes small 
pebbles from the brooks were mixed with the mortar to make bands across the 
house. All the timber of the floors, the rafters and crossbeams, the doorways, and 
the window lintels were &#0147;built in&#0148; as the house was carried up. 
After the house was roofed it was usually plastered inside and out to protect it 
against the weather and make it more comfortable. A great deal of trouble was 
often taken to obtain stone for the doorsteps, and curious rocks were sometimes 
brought many miles for this purpose, or for gate- posts in front of the dwelling.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indian houses were never more than 
one story high, also of adobe, but much smaller and with thinner walls. The 
inmates covered the earthen floors in part with coarse mats woven of tules, on 
which they slept. The Missions, as fast as possible, provided them with blankets, 
which were woven under the fathers&#0146; personal supervision, for home use 
and for sale. They were also taught to weave a coarse serge for clothing.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was between 1792 and 1795, as I have 
heard, that the governor brought a number of artisans from Mexico, and every 
Mission wanted them, but there were not enough to go around. There were 
masons, millwrights, tanners, shoemakers, saddlers, potters, a ribbon maker, and 
several weavers. The blankets and the coarse cloth I have spoken of were first 
woven in the southern Missions, San Gabriel, San Juan Capistrano, and others. 
About 1797 cotton cloth was also made in a few cases, and the cotton plant was 
found to grow very well. Hemp was woven at Monterey. Pottery was made at 
Mission Dolores, San Francisco. Soap was made in 1798, and afterwards at all the 
Missions and on many large ranches. The settlers themselves were obliged to 
learn trades and teach them to their servants, so that an educated young 
gentlemen was well skilled in many arts and handicrafts. He could ride, of 
course, as well as the best cow- boy of the Southwest, and with more grace; and 
he could throw the lasso so expertly that I never heard of any American who was 
able to equal it. He could also make soap, pottery, and bricks, burn lime, tan 
hides, cut out and put together a pair of shoes, make candles, roll cigars and do a 
great number of things that belong to different trades.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The California Indians were full of rude 
superstitions of every sort when the Franciscan fathers first began to teach them. 
It is hard to collect old Indian stories in these days, because they have become 
mixed up with what the fathers taught them. But the wild Indians a hundred 
years ago told the priests what they believed, and it was difficult to persuade 
them to give it up. In fact, there was more or less of what the fathers told them 
was &#0147;devil-worship&#0148; going on all the time. Rude stone altars were 
secretly built by the Mission Indians to &#0147;Cooksuy,&#0148; their dreaded 
god. They chose a lonely place in the hills and made piles of flat stones, five or 
six feet high. After that each Indian passing would throw something there, and 
his act of homage, called &#0147;pooish,&#0148; continued until the mound was 
covered with a curious collection of beads, feathers, shells from the coast, and 
even garments and food, which no Indian dared to touch. The fathers destroyed 
all such altars that they could discover, and punished the Indians who 
worshipped there. Sometimes the more ardent followers of Cooksuy had 
meetings at night, slipping away from the Indian village after the retiring-bell 
had rung and the alcalde&#0146;s rounds had been made. They prepared for the 
ceremony by fasting for several days; then they went to the chosen place, built a 
large fire, went through many dances, and called the god by a series of very 
strange and wild whistles, which always frightened any person who heard them. 
The old Indians, after being converted, told the priests that before they had seen 
the Spaniards come Cooksuy made his appearance from the midst of the fire in 
the form of a large white serpent; afterward the story was changed, and they 
reported that he sometimes took the form of a bull with fiery eyes.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indian alcaldes were appointed in the 
Mission towns to maintain order. Their duty was that of police officers; they 
were dressed better than the others, and wore shoes and stockings, which newly 
appointed officers dispensed with as often as possible, choosing to go barefoot, 
or with stockings only. When a vacancy in the office occurred the Indians 
themselves were asked which one they preferred of several suggested by the 
priest.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mission San Jos&#0233; had about five 
thousand Indian converts at the time of its greatest prosperity, and a number of 
Indian alcaldes were needed there. The alcaldes of the Spanish people in the 
pueblos were more like local judges, and were appointed by the governor.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indians who were personal attendants 
of the fathers were chosen with much care for their obedience and quickness of 
perception. Some of them seemed to have reached the very perfection of silent 
careful, unselfish service. They could be trusted with the most important matters, 
and they were strictly honest. Each father had his own private barber, who 
enjoyed the honor of a seat at the table with him, and generally accompanied him 
in journeys to other Missions. When the Missions were secularized, this custom, 
like many others, was abolished, and one Indian barber, named Telequis, felt the 
change in his position so much that when he was ordered out to the field with 
the others he committed suicide by eating the root of a poisonous wild plant, a 
species of celery.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indian vaqueros, who lived much of the 
time on the more distant cattle ranges, were a wild set of men. I remember one of 
them, named Martin, who was stationed in Amador Valley and became a leader 
of the hill vaqueros, who were very different from the vaqueros of the large 
valley near the Missions. He and his friends killed and ate three or four hundred 
young heifers belonging to the Mission, but when Easter approached he felt that 
he must confess his sins, so he went to Father Narciso and told all about it. The 
father forgave him, but ordered him to come in from the hills to the Mission and 
attend school until he could read. The rules were very strict; whoever failed 
twice in a lesson was always whipped. Martin was utterly unable to learn his 
letters, and he was whipped every day for a month; but he never complained. He 
was then dismissed, and went back to the hills. I used to question Martin about 
the affair, and he would tell me with perfect gravity of manner, which was very 
delightful, how many calves he had consumed and how wisely the good father 
had punished him. He knew now, he used to say, how very hard it was to live in 
the town, and he would never steal again lest he might have to go to school until 
he had learned his letters. It was the custom at all the Missions, during the rules 
of the Franciscan missionaries, to keep the young unmarried Indians separate. 
The Young girls and the young widows at the Mission San Jos&#0233; occupied a 
large adobe building, with a yard behind it, inclosed by high adobe walls. In this 
yard some trees were planed, and a zanja, [-- ]water-ditch supplied a large 
bathing-pond. The women were kept busy at various occupations, in the 
building, under the trees, or on the wide porch; they were taught spinning, 
knitting, the weaving of Indian baskets from grasses, willow rods and roots, and 
more especially plain sewing. The treatment and occupation of the unmarried 
women was similar at the other Missions. When heathen Indian women came in, 
or were brought by their friends, or by the soldiers, they were put in these 
houses, and under the charge of older women, who taught them what to do.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women, thus separated from the men, 
could only be courted from without through the upper windows facing on the 
narrow village street. These windows were about two feet square, crossed by 
iron bars, and perhaps three feet deep, as the adobe walls were very thick. The 
rules were not more strict, however, than still prevail in some of the Spanish- 
American countries in much higher classes, socially, than these uneducated 
Indians belonged to; in fact the rules were adopted by the fathers from Mexican 
models. After an Indian, in his hours of freedom from toil, had declared his 
affection by a sufficiently long attendance upon a certain window, it was the 
duty of the woman to tell the father missionary and to declare her decision. If this was favorable, the young man was asked if he was willing to contract 
marriage with the young woman who had confessed her preference. Sometimes 
there were several rival suitors, but it was never known that any trouble 
occurred. After marriage the couple were conducted to their home, a hut built for 
them among the other Indian houses in the village near the Mission.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indian mothers were frequently told 
about the proper care of children, and cleanliness of the person was strongly 
inculcated. In fact, the Mission Indians, large and small, were wonderfully clean, 
their faces and hair fairly shining with soap and water. In several cases where an 
Indian woman was so slovenly and neglectful of her infant that it died she was 
punished by being compelled to carry in her arms in church, and at all meals and 
public assemblies, a log of wood about the size of a nine-months&#0146;-old 
child. This was a very effectual punishment, for the Indian women are naturally 
most affectionate creatures, and in every case they soon began to suffer greatly, 
and others with them, so that once a whole Indian village begged the father in 
charge to forgive the poor woman.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The padres always had a school for the 
Indian boys. My mother has a novena, or &#0147;nine-days&#0146; devotion 
book&#0148; copied for her by one of the Indian pupils at the Mission San 
Jos&#0233; early in the  century. The handwriting is very neat and plain, and 
would be a credit to any one. Many young Indians had good voices, and these 
were selected with great care to be trained in singing for the church choir. It was 
thought such an honor to sing in church that, the Indian families were all very 
anxious to be represented. Some were taught to play on the violin and other 
stringed instruments. When Father Narciso Duran, who was the president of the 
Franciscans in California, was at the Mission San Jos&#0233;, he had a church 
choir of about thirty well-trained boys to sing the mass. He was himself a 
cultivated musician, having studied under some of the best masters in Spain, and 
so sensitive was his ear that if one string was out of tune he could not continue 
his service, but would at once turn to the choir, call the name of the player, and 
the string that was out of order, and wait until the matter was corrected. As there 
were often more than a dozen players on instruments. Every prominent Mission 
had fathers who paid great attention to training the Indians in music.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Spanish lady of high social standing tells 
the following story, which will illustrate the honor in which the Mission fathers 
were held:   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Majin Catala, one of the missionaries 
early in the century, was held to possess prophetic gifts, and many of the Spanish 
settlers, the Castros, Peraltas, Estudillos, and others, have reason to remember 
his gift. When any priest issued from the sacristy to celebrate mass all hearts 
were stirred, but with this holy father the feeling became one of absolute awe. On 
more than one occasion before his sermon he asked the congregation to join him 
in prayers for the soul of one about to die, naming the hour. In every case this 
was fulfilled to the very letter, and that in cases where the one who died could 
not have known of the father&#0146;s words. This saint spent his days in labor 
among the people, and he was loved as well as feared. But on one occasion, in 
later life, when the Mission rule was broken, he offended an Indian chief, and 
shortly after several Indians called at his home in the night to ask him to go and 
see a dying woman. The father rose and dressed, but his chamber door remained 
fast, so that he could not open it, and he was on the point of ordering them to 
break it open from without, when he felt a warning, to the effect that they were 
going to murder him. Then he said, &#0147;To-morrow I will visit your sick; you 
are forgiven; go in peace.&#0148; Then they fled in dismay, knowing that his 
person was protected by an especial providence, and soon after confessed their 
plans to the father.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was one of the most genial and kindly 
men of the missionaries, and he surprised all those who had thought that every 
one of the fathers was severe. He saw no harm in walking out among the young 
people, and saying friendly things to them all. He was often known to go with 
young men on moonlight rides, lassoing grizzly bears, or chasing deer on the 
plain. His own horse, one of the best ever seen in the valley, was richly 
caparisoned, and the father wore a scarlet silk sash around his waist under the 
Franciscan habit. When older and graver priests reproached him, he used to say 
with a smile that he was only a Mexican Franciscan, and that he was brought up 
in a saddle. He was certainly a superb rider.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said of Father Amoros of San Rafael that 
his noon meal consisted of an ear of dry corn, roasted over the coals. This he 
carried in his sleeve and partook of at his leisure while overseeing the Indian 
laborers. Some persons who were in the habit of reaching a priest&#0146;s house 
at noontime, so as to be asked to dinner, once called on the father, and were told 
that he had gone to the field with his corn in his manguilla, but they rode away 
without seeing him, which was considered a breach of good manners, and much 
fun was made over their haste.  

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal sources of revenue which the 
Missions enjoyed were the sales of hides and tallow, fresh beef, fruits, wheat, and 
other things to ships, and in occasional sales of horses to trappers or traders. The 
Russians at Fort Ross, north of San Francisco, on Bodega Bay, bought a good deal 
from the Missions. Then too the Indians were sent out to trade with other 
Indians, and so the Missions often secured many valuable furs, such as otter and 
beaver, together with skins of bears and deer killed by their own hunters.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The embarcadero, or &#0147;landing,&#0148; for the Mission San Jos&#0233; was at the mouth of a 
salt-water creek four or five miles away. When a ship sailed into San Francisco 
Bay, and the captain sent a large boat up this creek and arranged to buy hides, 
they were usually hauled there on an ox-cart with solid wooden wheels, called a 
carreta. But often in winter, there being no roads across the valley, each separate 
hide was doubled across the middle and placed on the head of an Indian. Long 
files of Indians, each carrying hide in this manner, could be seen over the 
unfenced level land through the wild mustard to the embarcadero, and in a few 
weeks the whole cargo would thus be delivered. For such work the Indians 
always received additional gifts for themselves and families.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very important feature, was the wheat 
harvest. Wheat was grown more or less at all the Missions. If those Americans 
who came to California in 1849 and said that wheat would not grow here had 
only visited the Missions they would have seen beautiful large wheat fields. Of 
course at first many mistakes were made by the fathers in their experiments, not 
only in wheat and corn, but also wine making, in crushing olives for oil, in 
grafting trees, and in creating fine flower and vegetable gardens. At most of the 
Missions it took them several years to find out how to grow good grain. At first 
they planted it on too wet land. At the Mission San Jos&#0233; a tract about a 
mile square came to be used for wheat. It was fenced in with a ditch, dug by the 
Indians with sharp sticks and with their hands in the rainy season, and it was so 
deep and wide that cattle and horses never crossed it. In other places stone or 
adobe walls, or hedges of the prickly pear cactus, were used about the wheat 
fields. Timber was never considered available for fences, because there were no 
saw-mill and no roads to the forests, so that it was only at great expense and 
with extreme difficulty that we procured the logs that were necessary in 
building, and chopped them slowly, with poor tools, to the size we wanted. 
Sometimes low adobe walls were made high and safe by a row of the skulls of 
Spanish cattle, with the long curving horns attached. These came from the 
matanzas or high Spanish came the matanzas, or slaughter-corrals, where there were thousands of them lying in piles, and they could be so used to make one of 
the strongest and most effective of barriers against man or beast. Set close and 
deep, at various angles, about the gateways and corral walls, these cattle horns 
helped to protect the inclosure from horse-thieves.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When wheat was sown it was merely 
&#0147;scratched in&#0148; with a wooden plow, but the ground was so new 
and rich that the yield was great. The old Mission field is now occupied by some 
of the best farms of the valley, showing how excellent was the fathers&#0146; 
judgment of good land. The old ditches which fenced it have been plowed in for 
more than forty years by American farmers, but their course can still be distinctly 
traced.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A special ceremony was connected with the close of the wheat harvest. The last four sheaves taken from this large field were 
tied to poles in the form of a cross, and were then brought by, the reapers in the 
&#0147;harvest procession&#0148; to the church, while the bells were rung, and 
the father, dressed in his robes, carrying the cross and accompanied by boys with 
tapers and censers, chanting the Te Deum as they marched, went forth to meet 
the sheaves. This was a season of Indian festival also, and one-fifth of the whole 
number of the Indians were sometimes allowed to leave the Mission for a certain 
number of days, to gather acorns, dig roots, hunt, fish, and enjoy a change of 
occupation. It was a privilege that they seldom, or never, abused by failing to 
return, and the fact shows how well they were treated in the Missions.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governor Neve proposed sowing wheat. I 
have heard, in 1776, and none had been sown in California before that time. At 
the pueblo of San Jos&#0233;, which was established in 1777, they planted wheat 
for the use of the presidios, and the first sowing was at the wrong season and 
failed, but the other half of their seed did better. The fathers at San Diego Mission 
sowed grain on the bottom lands in the willows the first year, and it was washed 
away; then they put it on the mesa above the Mission, and it died; the third year 
they found a good piece of land and it yielded one hundred and ninety-five fold. 
As soon as the Missions had wheat fields they wanted flour, and mortars were 
made. Some of them were holes cut in the rock, with a heavy pestle, lifted by a 
long pole. When La P&#0233;rouse, the French navigator, visited Monterey in 
1786, he gave the fathers in San Carlos an iron hand-mill, so that the neophyte 
women could more easily grind their wheat. He also gave the fathers seed-
potatoes from Chili, the first that were known in California. La P&#0233;rouse 
and his officers were received with much hospitality at San Carlos. The Indians 
were told that the Frenchmen were true Catholics, and Father Palou had them all 
assembled at the reception. Mrs. Ord, a daughter of the De la Guerra family, had 
a drawing of this occasion, made by an officer, but it was stolen about the time of 
the American conquest, like so many of the precious relics of Spanish California. 
La P&#0233;rouse wrote: &#0147;It is with the sweetest satisfaction that I shall 
make known the pious and wise conduct of these friars, who fulfill so perfectly 
the object of their institution. The greatest anchorites have never led a more 
edifying life.&#0148;   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the century flour-mills by water 
were built at Santa Cruz, San Luis Obispo, San Jos&#0233; and San Gabriel. The 
ruins of some of these now remain; the one at Santa Cruz is very picturesque. 
Horse-power mills were in use at many places. At the time that the Americans 
began to arrive in numbers the Spanish people were just commencing to project 
larger mill enterprises and irrigation ditches for their own needs. The difficulties 
with land titles put an end to most of these plans, and some of them were 
afterward carried out by Americans when the ranches were broken up.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the greatest of the early irrigation 
projects was that of my grandfather, Don Ygnacio Vallejo, who spent much labor 
and money in supplying San Luis Obispo Mission with water. This was begun in 
1776, and completed the following year. He so planned to carry the water of the 
Carmel River to Monterey; this has since been done by the Southern Pacific 
Railway Company. My father, Don J. J. Vallejo, about fifty years ago made a 
stone aqueduct and several irrigation and mill ditches from the Alameda Creek, 
on which stream he built an adobe flour-mill, whose millstones were brought 
from Spain.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have often been asked about the old 
Mission and ranch gardens. They were, I think, more extensive, and contained a 
greater variety of trees and plants, than most persons imagine. The Jesuits had 
gardens in Baja California as early as 1699, and vineyards and orchards a few 
years later. The Franciscans in Alta California began to cultivate the soil as soon 
as they landed. The first grapevines were brought from Lower California in 1769, 
and were soon planted at all the Missions except Dolores, where the climate was 
not suitable. Before the year 1800 the orchards at the Missions contained apples, 
pears, peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, figs, olives, oranges, pomegranates, At 
San Diego And San Buenaventura Missions there were also sugar canes, date 
palms, plantains, bananas, and citrons. There were orchards and vineyards in 
California sufficient to supply all the wants of the people. I remember that at the 
Mission San Jos&#0233; we had many varieties of seedling fruits which have now 
been lost to cultivation. Of pears we had four sorts, one ripening in early 
summer, one in late summer, and two in autumn and winter. The Spanish names 
of there pears were the Presidenta, the Bergamota, the Pana, and the Lechera. 
One of them was as large as a Bartlett, but there are no trees of it left now. The 
apples, grown from seed, ripened at different seasons, and there were seedling 
peaches, both early and late. An interesting and popular fruit was that of the 
Nopal, or prickley pear. This fruit, called tuna, grew on great hedges which 
protected part of the Mission orchards and were twenty feet high and ten or 
twelve feet thick. Those who know how to eat a tuna, peeling it so as to escape 
the tiny thorns on the skin, find it delicious.  

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Missions had avenues of fig, olive, and 
other trees about the building, besides the orchards. In later times American 
squatters and campers often cut down these trees for firewood or built fires 
against the trunks, which killed them. Several hundred large and valuable olive 
trees at the San Diego Mission were killed in this way. The old orchards were 
pruned and cultivated with much care, and the paths were swept by the Indians, 
but after the sequestration of the Mission property they were neglected and ran 
wild. The olive-mills, and wine-presses were destroyed, and cattle were pastured 
in the once fruitful groves.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flower gardens were gay with roses, 
chiefly a pink and very fragrant sort from Mexico, called by us the Castilian rose, 
and still seen in a few old gardens. Besides roses, we had pinks, sweet-peas, 
hollyhocks, nasturtiums which had been brought from Mexico, and white lilies. 
The vegetable gardens contained pease, beans, beets, lentils, onions, carrots, red 
peppers, corn, potatoes, squashes, cucumbers, and melons. A fine quality of 
tobacco was cultivated and cured by the Indians. Hemp and flax were grown to 
some extent. A fine large cane, a native of Mexico, was planted, and the joints 
found useful as in the blanket factory, and for many domestic purposes. The 
young shoots of this cane were sometimes cooked for food. Other kinds of plants 
were grown in the old gardens, but these are all that I can remember.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the old days every one seemed to live 
out-doors. There was much gaiety and social life, even though people were 
widely scattered. We traveled as much as possible on horseback. Only old people 
or invalids cared to use the slow cart, or carreta. Young men would ride from 
one ranch to another for parties, and whoever found his horse tired would let 
him go and catch another. In 1806 there were so many horses in the valleys about 
San Jos&#0233; that seven or eight thousand were killed. Nearly as many were 
driven into the sea at Santa Barbara in 1801, and the same thing was done at 
Monterey in 1810. Horses were given to the runaway sailors, and to trappers and 
hunters who came over the mountains, for common horses were very plenty, but 
fast and beautiful horses were never more prized in any country than in 
California, and each young man had his favorites. A kind of mustang, that is 
now seldom or never seen on the Pacific coast, was a peculiar light cream-colored 
horse, with silver-white mane and tail. Such an animal, of speed and 
bottom, often sold for more than a horse of any other color. Other much admired 
colors were dapple-gray and chestnut. The fathers of the Mission sometimes rode 
on horseback, but they generally had a somewhat modern carriage called a 
volante. It was always drawn by mules, of which there were hundreds in the 
Mission pastures, and white was the color often preferred.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing was more attractive than the 
wedding cavalcade on its way from the bride&#0146;s house to the Mission 
church. The horses were more richly caparisoned than for any other ceremony, 
and the bride&#0146;s nearest relative or family representative carried her before 
him, she sitting on the saddle with her white satin shoe in a loop of golden or 
silver braid, while he sat on the bear-skin covered anquera behind. The groom 
and his friends mingled with the bride&#0146;s party, all on the best horses that 
could be obtained, and they rode gaily from the ranch house to the Mission, 
sometimes fifteen or twenty miles away. In April and May, when the land was 
covered with wild-flowers, the light-hearted troop rode along the edge of the 
uplands, between hill and valley, crossing the streams, and some of the young 
horsemen, anxious to show their skill, would perform all the feats for which the 
Spanish-Californians were famous. After the wedding, when they returned to 
lead in the feasting, the bride was carried on the horse of the groomsman. One of 
the customs which was always observed at the wedding was to wind a silken 
tasseled string or a silken sash, fringed with gold, about the necks of the bride 
and groom, binding them together as they knelt before the altar for the blessing 
of the priest. A charming custom among the middle and lower classes was the 
making of the satin shoes by the groom for the bride. A few weeks before the 
wedding he asked his betrothed for the measurement of her foot, and made the 
shoes with his own hands; the groomsman brought them to her on the wedding-
day.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But few foreigners ever visited any of the 
Missions, and they naturally caused quite a stir. At the Mission San Jos&#0233;, 
about 1820, late one night in the vintage season a man came to the village for 
food and shelter, which were gladly given. But the next day it was whispered 
that he was a Jew, and the poor Indians, who had been told that the Jews had 
crucified Christ, ran to their huts and hid. Even the Spanish children, and many 
of the grown people, were frightened. Only the missionary father had ever 
before seen a Jew, and when he found that it was impossible to check the 
excitement he sent two soldiers to ride with the man a portion of the way to 
Santa Clara.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of trappers and hunters came into 
Southern California and settled down in various towns. There was a party of 
Kentuckians, beaver-trappers, who went along the Gila and Colorado rivers 
about 1827, and then south into Baja California to the Mission of Santa Catalina. 
Then they came to San Diego, where the whole country was much excited over 
their hunter clothes, their rifles, their traps, and the strange stories they told of 
the deserts, and fierce Indians, and things that no one in California had ever 
seen. Captain Paty was the oldest man of the party, and he was ill and worn out. 
All the San Diego people were very kind to the Americans. It is said that the 
other Misdons, such as San Gabriel, sent and desired the privilege of caring for 
some of them. Captain Paty grew worse, so he sent for one of the fathers and said 
he wished to become a Catholic, because he added, it must be a good religion, for 
it made everybody so good to him. Don Pio Pico and Doña Victoria Dominguez 
de Estudillo were his sponsors. After Captain Paty&#0146;s death the Americans 
went to Los Angeles, where they all married Spanish ladies, were given lands, 
built houses, planted vineyards and became important people. Pryor repaired 
the church silver, and was called &#0147;Miguel el Platero.&#0148; Laughlin was 
always so merry that he was named &#0147;Ricardo el Buen Mozo.&#0148; They 
all had Spanish names given them besides their own. One of them was a 
blacksmith, and as iron was very scarce he made pruning shears for the 
vineyards out of the old beaver traps.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Christmas night, 1828, a ship was 
wrecked near Los Angeles, and twenty-eight men escaped. Everybody wanted to 
care for them, and they were given a great Christmas dinner, and offered money 
and lands. Some of them staid, and some went to other Missions and towns. One 
of them who staid was a German, John Gronigen, and he was named 
&#0147;Juan Domingo&#0148; or, because he was lame, &#0147;Juan 
Cojo.&#0148; Another, named Prentice, came from Connecticut, and he was a 
famous fisherman and otter hunter. After 1828 a good many other Americans 
came in and settled down quietly to cultivate the soil, and some of them became 
very rich. They had grants from the governor, just the same as the Spanish 
people. It is necessary, for the truth of the account, to mention the evil behavior 
of many Americans before, as well as after, the conquest. At the Mission San 
Jos&#0233; there is a small creek and two very large sycamores once grew at the 
Spanish ford, so that it was called la aliso. A squatter named Fallon, who lived 
near the crossing, cut down these for firewood, though there were many trees in 
the cañon. The Spanish people begged him to leave them, for the shade, but he 
did not care for that. This was a little thing, but much that happened was after 
such pattern, or far worse.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those times one of the leading American 
squatters came to my father, Don J.J. Vallejo, and said, &#0147;There is a large 
piece of your land where the cattle run loose, and your vaqueros have gone to 
the gold fields. I will fence the field for you at my expense if you will give me 
half.&#0148; He liked the idea, and assented, but when the tract was inclosed the 
American had it entered as government land in his own name, and kept all of it. 
In many similar cases American settlers in their dealings with the rancheros took 
advantage of the laws which they understood, but which were new to the 
Spaniards, so robbed the latter of their lands. Notes and bonds were considered 
unnecessary by a Spanish gentleman in a business transaction, as his word was 
always sufficient security.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the most exasperating feature of the 
coming-in of the Americans was owing to the mines, which drew away most of 
the servants, so that our cattle were stolen by thousands. Men who are now 
prosperous farmers and merchants were guilty of shooting and selling Spanish 
beef &#0147;without looking at the brand,&#0148; as the phrase went. My father 
had about ten thousand head of cattle, and some he was able to send back into 
the hills until there were better laws and officers, but he lost the larger part. On 
one occasion I remember some vigilantes caught two cattle-thieves and sent for 
my father to appear against them, but he said that although he wanted them 
punished he did not wish to have them hanged, and so he would not testify, and 
they were set free. One of them afterward sent conscience money to us from New 
York, where he is living in good circumstances. The Vallejos have on several 
occasions received conscience money from different parts of the country. The 
latest case occurred last year (1899), when a woman wrote that her husband, 
since dead, had taken a steer worth twenty-five dollars, and she sent the money.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every Mission and ranch in old times had its 
calaveras, its &#0147;place of skulls,&#0148; its slaughter corral, where cattle and 
sheep were killed by the Indian butchers Every Saturday morning the fattest 
animals were chosen and driven there, and by night the hides were all stretched 
on the hillside to dry. At one time a hundred cattle and two hundred sheep were 
killed weekly at the Mission San Jos&#0233;, and the meat was distributed to all, 
&#0147;without money and without price.&#0148; The grizzly bears, which were 
very abundant in the country, - for no one ever poisoned them, as the American 
stock raisers did after 1849, - used to come by night to the ravines near the 
slaughter-corral where the refuse was thrown by the butchers. The young 
Spanish gentlemen often rode out on moonlight nights to lasso these bears, and 
then they would drag them through the village street, and past the houses of 
their friends. Two men with their strong rawhide reatas could hold any bear, and 
when they were tired of this sport they could kill him. But sometimes the bears 
would walk through the village on their way to or from the corral of the 
butchers, and so scatter the people. Several times a serenade party, singing and 
playing by moonlight, was suddenly broken up by two or three grizzlies trotting 
down the hill into the street, and the gay caballeros with their guitars would 
spring over the adobe walls and run for their horses, which always stood 
saddled, with a reata coiled, ready for use, as a saddle bow. It was the custom in 
every family to keep saddled horses in easy reach, day and night.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Innumerable stories about grizzlies are 
traditional in the old Spanish families, not only in the Santa Clara Valley, but also 
through the Coast Range from San Diego to Sonoma and Santa Rosa. Some of the 
bravest of the young men would go out alone to kill grizzlies. When they had 
lassoed one they would drag him to a tree, and the well-trained horse would 
hold the bear against it while the hunter slipped out of the saddle, ran up, and 
killed the grizzly with one stroke of his broad-bladed machete, or Mexican 
hunting knife. One Spanish gentlemen riding after a large grizzly lassoed it and 
was dragged into a deep barranca. Horse and man fell on the bear, and 
astonished him so much that he scrambled up the bank, and the hunter cut the 
reata and gladly enough let him go. There were many cases of herdsmen and 
hunters being killed by grizzlies, and one could fill a volume with stories of feats 
of courage and of mastery of the reata. The governor of California appointed 
expert bear hunters in different parts of the country, who spent their time in 
destroying them, by pits, or shooting, or with the reata. Don Rafael Soto, one of 
the most famous of these men used to conceal himself in a pit, covered with 
heavy logs and leaves, with a quarter of freshly killed beef above. When the 
grizzly bear walked on the logs he was shot from beneath. Before the feast- days 
the hunters sometimes went to the foothills and brought several bears to turn 
into the bull-fighting corral, The principal bull- fights were held at Easter and on 
the day of the patron saint of the Mission, which at the Mission San Jos&#0233; 
was March 19. Young gentlemen who had trained for the contest entered the ring 
on foot and on horseback, after the Mexican manner. In the bull and bear fights a 
hind foot of the bear was often tied to the forefoot of the bull, to equalize the 
struggle, for a large grizzly was more than a match for the fiercest bull in 
California, or indeed of any other country. Bull and bear fights continued as late 
as 1855. The Indians were the most ardent supporters of this cruel sport.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The days of the rodeos, when cattle were 
driven in from the surrounding pastures, and the herds of the different ranches 
were separated, were notable episodes. The ranch owners elected three or five 
juezes del campo to govern the proceedings and decide disputes. After the rodeo 
there was a feast. The great feast-days, however, were December 12 (the day of 
our Lady Guadalupe), Christmas, Easter, and St. Joseph&#0146;s Day, or the day 
of the patron saint of the Mission.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family life among the old Spanish pioneers 
was an affair of dignity and ceremony, but it did not lack in affection. Children 
were brought up with great respect for their elders. It was the privilege of any 
elderly person to correct young people by words, or even by whipping them, 
and it was never told that any one thus chastised made a complaint. Each one of 
the old families taught their children the history of the family, and reverence 
toward religion. A few books, some in manuscript, were treasured in the 
household, but children were not allowed to read novels until were grown. They 
saw little of other children, except their near relatives, but they had many 
enjoyments unknown to children now, and they grew up with remarkable 
strength and healthfulness.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these days of trade, bustle, and confusion, 
when many thousands of people live in the Californian valleys, which formerly 
were occupied by only a few Spanish families, the quiet and happy domestic life 
of the past seem like a dream. We, who loved it, often speak of those days, and 
especially of the duties of the large Spanish households, where so many, 
dependents were to be cared for, and everything was done in a simple and 
primitive way.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a group of warm springs a few 
miles distant from the old adobe house in which we lived. It made us children 
happy to be waked before sunrise to prepare for the &#0147;wash-day 
expedition&#0148; to the Agua Caliente. The night before the Indians had soaped 
the clumsy carretas great wheels. Lunch was placed in baskets, and the gentle 
oxen were yoked to the pole. We climbed in, under the green cloth of an old 
Mexican flag which was used as an awning, and the white-haired Indian ganan, 
who had driven the carreta since his boyhood, plodded beside with his long 
garrocha, or ox-goad. The great piles of soiled linen were fastened on the backs 
of horses, led by other servants, while the girls and women who were to do the 
washing trooped along by the side of the carreta. All in all, it made an imposing 
cavalcade, though our progress was slow, and it was generally sunrise before we 
had fairly reached the spring. The oxen pulled us up the slope of the ravine, 
where it was so steep that we often cried, &#0147;Mother, let us dismount and 
walk, so as to make it easier.&#0148; The steps of the carreta so low that we 
could climb, in, or out without stopping the oxen. The watchful mother guided 
the whole party, seeing that none strayed too far after flowers, or loitered too 
long talking with the others. Sometimes we heard the howl of coyotes, and the 
noise of other wild animals in the dim dawn, and then none of the children were 
allowed to leave the carreta.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great dark mountain rose behind the hot 
spring, and the broad, beautiful valley, unfenced, and dotted with browsing 
herds, sloped down to the bay as we climbed the cañon to where columns of 
white steam rose among the oaks, and the precious waters, which were strong 
with sulphur, were seen flowing over the crusted basin, and falling down a worn 
rock channel to the brook. Now on these mountain slopes for miles are the 
vineyards of Josiah Stanford, the brother of Senator Leland Stanford, and the 
valley below is filled with towns and orchards.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We watched the women unload the linen 
and carry it to the upper spring of the group, where the water was best. Then 
they loosened the horses, and let the pasture on the wild oats, while the women put home-made soap on the clothes, dipped them in the spring, and rubbed them 
on the smooth rocks until they were white as snow. Then they would spread out 
to dry on the tops of the low bushes growing on the warm, windless, southern 
slopes of the mountain. There was sometimes a great deal of linen to be washed, 
for it was the pride of every Spanish family to own much linen, and the mother 
and daughters almost always wore white. I have heard strangers speak of the 
wonderful way in which Spanish ladies of the upper classes in California always 
appeared in snow-white dresses, and certainly to do so was one of the chief 
anxieties of every household. Where there were no warm springs the servants of 
the family repaired to the nearest arroyo, or creek, and stood knee-deep in it, 
dipping and rubbing the linen, and enjoying the sport. In the rainy season the 
soiled linen sometimes accumulated for several weeks before the weather 
permitted the house mistress to have a wash-day. Then, when at last it came, it 
seemed as if half the village, with dozens of babies and youngsters, wanted to go 
along too and make a spring picnic.   

<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group of hot sulphur-springs, so useful 
on wash-days, was a famed resort for sick people, who drank the water, and also 
buried themselves up to the neck in the soft mud of the slope below the spring, 
where the waste waters ran. Their friends brought them in litters and scooped 
out a hole for them, then put boughs overhead to shelter them from the hot sun, 
and placed food and fresh water within reach, leaving them sometimes thus from 
sunrise to sunset. The Paso Robles and Gilroy Springs were among the most 
famous on the coast in those days, and after the annual rodeos people often went 
there to camp and to use the waters. But many writers have told about the 
medicinal virtues of the various California springs, and I need not enlarge upon 
the subject. To me, at least, one of the dearest of my childish memories is the 
family expedition from the great thick-walled adobe, under the olive and fig 
trees of the Mission, to the Agua Caliente in early dawn, and the late return at 
twilight, when the younger children were all asleep in the slow carreta, and the 
Indians were signing hymns as they drove the linen-laden horses down the 
dusky ravines.  <BR><BR>

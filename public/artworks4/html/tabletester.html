This is one of the exceedingly rare complete pieces of ancient terracotta collected from Nigeria. This pose, with the seated male dignitary or ancestor with arms across the knees and head resting on the arms, was a favorite of Nok artists, and is often labeled “The Thinker” by contemporary scholars.</td></tr></table> </td><td>

&nbsp; This page is a demonstration of nestled tables in HTML. There are five separate tables here. Four of the tables are nestled in three cells (columns) of the master (outside) table. For clarity, all tables have borders. The top and bottom rows of the master table use the colspan attribute to span across all three columns. Use <b>Source</b> on your browser to see the codes that make this page. <br>

&nbsp; The Nok terracotta image and text are from the 
<b><a href="http://www.sujaro.com/">Sujaro</b> Gallery of African Art</a> website and of course are copyrighted by Sujaro's owner, Andrew J. Berz. Nok terracotta is perhaps the most intriguing of west African artifacts.  Thermoluminescence testing authenticates its antiquity. Nok terracotta is ancient. It predates the much sought after Benin bronzes and even the earlier very rare Igbo-Ukwu bronzes. Nok terracotta is the <i>pièce de résistance</i> of west African art.

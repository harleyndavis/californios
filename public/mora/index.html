&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Jacinto &#0147;Jo&#0148; Mora, born 22 October 
1876 in Uruguay, died 10 October 1947 in Monterey California, just short 
of his seventy-first birthday. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jo Mora came to the 
United States as a child, he studied 
art in the New York, then worked for Boston 
newspapers as a cartoonist. He was a man of many other talents, 
artist-historian, sculptor, painter, photographer, illustrator, 
muralist and author. Later in life, he became quite a renown artist. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1903, Mora came to California, then in 1904 he moved to Keams Canyon in northeast Arizona,  
living with the Hopi and Navajo Indians. He learned their languages and photographed and
painted an ethnological record, particularly of the Kachina ceremonial dances. 
In 1907, he marred Grace Needham and they moved to Mountain View California.  He moved 
to Pebble Beach in 1922 and established a home and large studio there, it being 
near the <A HREF="http://www.carmelmission.org/">Carmel 
Mission</A> (San Carlos Borrom&#0233;o 
De Carmelo Mission) after being 
commissioned to do the <I>Serra <A HREF="serra.gif">Sarcophagus</A></I>* for Padre (Father) Ramon 
Mestres. The bronze and travertine marble sarcophagus showing Padre Serra lying in state with his friends
Padres Crespi, L&#0243;pez, and Lasu&#0233;n around him  was unveiled on 12 October 1924.  Note that 
Padre Crespi died before Father Serra; Mora took a bit of artistic license here, but his work is 
certainly in keeping with the spirit. (* Note that a sarcophagus is an above ground box or tomb that 
contains a body. The memorial never contained Padre Serra&#0146;s remains. The correct 
name for the monument is <I>Cenotaph</I>.) Mora also worked in ceramics, wood and stone. 
&#0147;<A HREF="el-paseo.html">The Greeting</A>&#0148; from 1928 is still a Carmel delight. Another of his 
<A HREF="serra1.jpg">tributes</A> to Padre Serra greets new arrivals to Carmel 
(<A HREF="serra2.jpg">detail</A>). <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During his long and productive career, Mora illustrated a number of books 
including <I>Animals of Aesop</I> (1900), <I><A HREF="dons.jpg">Dawn and the Dons</A> -

his posthumous publication, <I><A HREF="jo-mora.gif">Californios</A></I> (1949). <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cartes (charts, maps, posters) include <I>California</I>,

cartes are extremely collectible.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In 1996, the Book Club of California selected Mora as one of the
state&#0146;s outstanding book illustrators. Mora is also listed in Jeff Dykes&#0146; <I>Fifty Great 
Western Illustrators: A Bibliographic Checklist</I>.   <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Please do <B>not</B> send emails to me with questions about the various editions of 
Jo Mora&#0146;s work or about the value of those editions. I do not specifically collect 
original Jo Mora cartes and I am disinterested in how much profit may be made by selling 
an original Mora carte. Be aware that the publication rights to certain cartes were sold by 
Jo N. Mora (the artist&#0146;s son) to Jim Meyer Graphics, Inc., so therefore, the Meyer 
reprints are legal and authorized. The reprints are excellent. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2005 retail price of authorized reproduction cartes 
usually is in the thirty-five to forty dollar range, while a pristine (unfaded, 
untorn, unfolded, etc.) original carte may run as high as twelve hundred dollars. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.</B>&nbsp; Used copies of Jo Mora&#0146;s books may often be found at 
Antiquarian Book Dealers. Many of those dealers offer their holdings through Advanced 
Book Exchange (ABE). A search of the <A HREF="http://www.abebooks.com/">ABE website</A> 
is recommended. <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.</B>&nbsp; The <I><A HREF="http://www.caviews.com/jomora.htm">Pat 
Hathaway Collection of Historical Photos</A></I> offers for sale, over 100 images by Lewis Josselyn 
of Jo Mora at work. <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.</B>&nbsp; Today, you can see in Golden Gate Park (San Francisco CA), 
the Jo Mora sculpture of Don Quixote and his squire, Sancho Panza kneeling before and paying homage 
to the bust of their creator, Don Miguel of Cervantes Saavedra (Cervantes). 
(Area temporarily closed during construction of the new but grossly uninspired <I>de Young Museum</I>.) <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.</B>&nbsp; Jo Mora&#0146;s book, <I>A Log of the 
Spanish Main</I>, was purchased by the Grace Steamship 
Line (W. R. Grace &#038; Co.) and they offered it to their passengers. The pages could 
be changed to conform to different routes 
sailed, and ample space was provided for the passengers to write in their experiences. Therefore each 
used copy is unique and charming.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>6.</B>&nbsp; Two excellent sources for identifing most if not all 
of Jo Mora&#0146;s work is <I>Collecting Jo Mora</I> by Joss Grandeau and 
Don Short, 1995, and <I>Back to the Drawing Board with Artist Jo Mora</I>, by Julianne

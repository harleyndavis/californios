&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My cousin Myra Elizabeth &#0147;Lib&#0148; Chastain 
and I first saw this old house while searching the back roads of south-west 
Warren County Tennessee. On Andy McGowan road (a dead end road) 
we saw an old house with some pioneer 
stone work in an old chimney. This house, located on the farm of E.L. 
Maynard, has now been removed. This house and farm was the home of John and Nancy Anderson, 
and was later purchased by John&#0146;s nephew Elijah Anderson in the 1850s. 
Elijah Anderson lived there with his younger siblings (the minor children of James and 
Elizabeth Smoot Anderson). (It appears that John&#0146;s widow, Nancy Anderson, and most 
of their adult moved to Arkansas in the 1850s.) Next, the house became the home 
Elijah&#0146;s son, Isaac Alexander Anderson, then it passed to 
Isaac A. Anderson&#0146;s daughter Elizabeth Anderson, her husband 
Andy McGowan and sister Mary Ellen Anderson. This house was 
probably built in the 1820s by John Anderson (d.1836) and his brother 
James Anderson (d.1846). <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Anderson house as seen in 1993 was a two room log home 
with an enclosed &#0147;dogtrot&#0148; (a breeze-way). The house had been much 
modified during its 170 plus years. It also was not a pure traditional 
dogtrot style house since it had the chimneys on the south wall of each pen (room). <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993, we found the house covered with old wood siding, a 
very common &#0147;improvement&#0148; to old log houses. There was an 
extremely early kitchen addition and a more modern cinder 
block garage. The windows would not have been part of the original construction. They may 
have been added by Andy McGowan. It is said that Andy had the house 
updated in the 1940s which no doubt saved it from destruction. 
For an old log house of its antiquity, it was in 
remarkably good condition. Mr. Maynard showed us the interior, 
even removing some modern paneling to expose the 
primitive hidden stone work. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of the house was a large 
flat rock, that we are told is called a &#0147;upen rock.&#0148; 
Seems in the olden days the ladies would get upen the rock, 
then upen the horse. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a trip to house 
in May of 1995, we found the house about 
to be disassembled and removed to Georgia or North 
Carolina. The contractor has exposed the old logs so a customer 
could see the original construction. It was obvious that 
the building was constructed as two structures, the earliest, a 
single story cabin (20' x 20' sq.), being on the south.  Later 
a one &#038; a half story building (or pen), with a 
brick chimney, was built to the north 
(also 20' x 20' sq.). The stone work on the southern 
most chimney (and also the kitchen addition) was older 
than the brick chimney in the middle of the &#0145;dog trot.&#0146; 
Therefore it shows that the southern most 
pen to be the earliest built. At an even later date, the 
&#0145;dog trot&#0146; between the two pens 
was enclosed.  At that time, the walls of the shorter, earlier 
pen were raised to match the other pen 
and a new roof was constructed over the old section and the 
then new dog trot. Apparently, the early stone chimneys 
had brick extensions added when the higher roof was added. The 
walls of the dog trot and the upper addition to the 
southern most pen were framed in with hand hewn lumber 
and were not of the log construction of the original two 
pens. Square nails were used for framing in the dog trot.<BR>

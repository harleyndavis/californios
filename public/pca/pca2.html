&nbsp;&#0147;Little Grey Home in the West,&#0148; sung about, 
described and pictured so alluringly, has changed its hue; at present 
it is anything but grey; it is often salmon pink, blue-green or canary yellow. 
Sometimes it is a combination of these, or it may be in neutral tone with 
vermillion doors and windowsashes; blue, crimson and orange flowers 
in decorative window boxes supply touches of brilliant color in small areas. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surroundings, of course, influence the use of 
color in small houses, as it is often necessary to build on a correspondingly 
small lot-which brings into consideration the dweller next door, who may desire 
a hue which does not harmonize with his neighbor&#0146;s color scheme. Taking into 
consideration the color of sky, ocean, trees and flowers of the Southwest, 
there is a certain aesthetic satisfaction in houses of cream or buff, with the 
color note accented in trim and garden planting. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In New Mexico and Arizona, southern California 
and southwestern Texas, is a revival of &#0147;adobe&#0148; building, of Indian construction, 
based on a purely native architecture founded upon the Spanish model built in a 
simpler way with materials at hand, after the manner of the Indian builders. A few 
of these old buildings have been reclaimed, of which the Spanish Missions and the 
&#0147;Adobe Flores&#0148; of Southern California are famous examples, and serve as models and 
sources of inspiration for modern builders to study. Most of these have crumbled away, 
&#0147;melted into the earth,&#0148; as the Indianbuilt adobes will if not covered with a hard 
outside plaster The Indian method was to replaster every year, patting and smoothing 
the finish by hand, which resulted in softly rounded contours and pleasing texture Modern 
adobes are finished with a hard plaster which preserves the sun-dried brick, and by 
using color in soft tints, gives an appearance of antiquity. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Hollywood are some 
fine examples of modern adobe designed and built by Mr. John Byers, who is an authority 
on this particularly American type of architecture, fathered by the &#0147;Native 
American,&#0148; 
modified to suit the needs of the white conqueror. <BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">[<A HREF="p-27-photo.jpg">Various Views, p.27</A>] </FONT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adobes used in the houses designed by Mr. Byers 
are made by workmen imported from Mexico; men whose trade has been handed down from 
father to son for generations, and who take a craftsman&#0146;s pride in fine workmanship. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The method of obtaining clay is simple--it is dug out 
of the foundation of the house. What comes out of the cellar, with that which is taken 
off the yard in grading, is sufficient for the walls, It is interesting to watch these 
brick-makers with trousers rolled up, performing the operation of treading the 
watered earth; straw and barnyard refuse is hoed and worked into the mass after 
it has been treaded to the proper consistency. The mud is then set in molds 4x20x18 
inches and dried in the sun. These molds are made of clear lumber securely joined 
and smooth on the inside surfaces. In hot weather ten or twelve days are sufficient 
to dry the bricks. They are then laid in mortar made of lime and sand. The 
illustration shows the method of conveying adobes to the bricklayers. The peon&#0146;s 
head is his hod, protected by a little cloth roll the size of a doughnut. Outside 
plaster consists of sharp sand, cement, and 8 or 10 percent hydrated lime-the 
latter to make the coating water-proof. About the outside walls chicken or hog 
wire is used as a reinforcing for the cement plaster. Floors are sometimes of 
concrete marked off into square tiles; the most satisfactory flooring which 
harmonizes with the bricks, is a hand-made tile. Mr. Byers, not finding the 
thing he considers suitable in a commercial product, manufactures his own 
roofing and flooring tile, expert Mexican workmen being employed for the purpose. 
The roof of an adobe house, to be in keeping, seems to call for tile. Some houses 
are roofed with split shakes stained grey or green and put on in a manner which 
suggests weather staining; but when you realize the thickness of an adobe wall, a 
tile roof with its warm color note, and its overhang which casts leasing shadows, 
and forms a substantial protection For the wall, seems to satisfy aesthetically as 
well as fulfill practical requirements. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inside walls are uniformly plastered, 
then tinted, left in a rough state or stained. A beautiful finish is obtained by 
several coats of paint hand rubbed. Another interesting effect is obtained by 
scraping a steel float along the surface of the plaster, which carries up some 
of the sand leaving tiny holes, which resembles Travatine marble. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interest of the Spanish Colonial house is not 
entirely centered upon the front. The rear is oftentimes even more inviting with 
its bit of garden, its &#0147;placita&#0148; or little plaza which is really 
an out-of-doors room. 
Here one can enjoy his garden, and take out-door recreation without being exposed to 
public view while so doing. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In furnishing and decorating these houses there may 
be considerable latitude allowed. If your taste runs toward barbaric splendor of 
color you will surround yourself with rugs and pottery from the Southwest, brilliant 
in hue and bold in design. Or, you may incline toward the simplicity and severity of 
the early Missions. One exceptionally beautiful adobe home in Beverly Hills belonging 
to Mr. Arthur Rosson, is furnished in the Spanish Rennaisance manner, and contains 
some rare antiques from Seville and Granada, treasures assembled bt the owner during 
a sojourn in Spain.

<font color="#FF0000">SMOOT, Bethel Campbell&nbsp; (circa 1914 - 2000)</font></H3>
<DD>Medical pioneer dies at 86: Treatment came first, payment was secondary
for Dr. Smoot
<BR>
<DD>Prominent local physician Dr. Bethel Campbell (B.C.) Smoot, Sr. died
Sunday at River Park Hospital, the facility he co-founded in 1972 with
the late Dr. Thomas Frist and HCA group.&nbsp; He was 86 and had suffered
from a lingering illness.
<BR>
<DD>Dr. Smoot was a general practitioner and surgeon in Warren County and the
surrounding area, practicing medicine from 1937 until his retirement in
1976.&nbsp; Early in his practice he was associated with the Medical Clinic
and Hospital, which he later co-owned with Dr. C.M. Clark and continued
to operate until it closed in the mid-70s to make way for the new River
Park Hospital.&nbsp; A wing of the hospital was later named in his honor.
<BR>
<DD>Dr. Smoot was known as a community doctor, often making house calls.&nbsp;
He delivered an estimated 6,000 babies during his career.&nbsp; He was
known in the community as the doctor who never kept records&nbsp; because
he knew each of his patients by heart.
<BR>
<DD>&#0147;Dr. Smoot had an enormous impact on the community,&#0148; said Dr. Ray Troop,
who began working with Dr. Smoot in 1970.&nbsp; &#0147;He came along when there
wasn&#0146;t a lot of doctors.&nbsp; Back then the main thing they had to offer
was themselves and reassurance.&nbsp; Dr. Smoot was in practice several
years before penicillin came along.&#0148;&nbsp; Dr. Troop pointed out his colleague
worked night and day and was always available to his patients.&nbsp; &#0147;At
one time, I&#0146;d say about 50 percent of his work was home visits,&#0148; Troop
said.&nbsp; &#0147;He would make house calls and do home deliveries.&nbsp; He
probably delivered about half the people in this town.&#0148;&nbsp; Dr. Troop
noted Dr. Smoot&#0146;s wife, Jonnye Smoot, was instrumental in his practice,
helping him coordinate what was normally a busy,&nbsp; around-the-clock
schedule.&nbsp; Dr. Troop also cited Dr. Smoot&#0146;s efforts in founding River
Park Hospital here.&nbsp; &#0147;River Park changed the complexion of medical
care here,&#0148; Dr. Troop said.
<BR>
<DD>G.B. Greene, who was a fellow member of Rotary and served on the River
Park Board of Directors with Dr. Smoot, described the doctor&nbsp; as a
&#0147;good, dependable person.&#0148;
<BR>
<DD>&#0147;He was an outstanding medical professional,&#0148; Greene said. &#0147;I know a lot
of patients who couldn&#0146;t afford their bills, he wouldn&#0146;t even send a bill.
He had a front as a rough and tough person but inside he was really a generous
and kind man.&#0148;
<BR>
<DD>Dr. Smoot was honored by his community for the designated Dr. Smoot Day
enacted in Morrison in August 1967, and by the VFW as Citizen of the Year.
He was honored by his fellow physicians at River Park Hospital when named
Chief of Staff Emeritus.
<BR>
<DD>Dr. Smoot was founder and former director of the Security Federal Savings
and Loan Association.&nbsp; He was a member of Rotary Club International
and a Shriner.&nbsp; He served on the Warren County Child Abuse Board and
was a member of the Church of Christ.&nbsp; He served as a lieutenant with
the CCC in Brunswick, Ga.
<BR>
<DD>An avid angler, Dr. Smoot fished from Cuba to the Arctic Ocean.
<BR>
He was married to the late Jonnye Walker Smoot who preceded him in death
in 1996.&nbsp; He was the son of the late Bethel Merthon and Laura Elizabeth
Edwards Smoot.
<BR>
<DD>He is survived by son, Campbell Smoot Jr. and daughter, Kathleen Smoot-Kemezis,
both of Tullahoma; 10 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
<BR>
<DD>Services will be held at 2 p.m. today at High&#0146;s Chapel with Paul Roberts
and Laird Bryson officiating. Burial will follow at Morrison Cemetery.&nbsp;
Visitation will be held from 10 a.m. until time of service today at High&#0146;s.
Memorials may be made to the American Cancer Society or the National Kidney
Foundation.

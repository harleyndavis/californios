<DIV ALIGN="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 5 August 1878, the County Court of Warren County Tennessee found 
William Smoot to be &#0147;. . . of unsound Mind for about 8 or so Months.&#0148; 
Apparently William was soon thereafter committed to <I>Tennessee Hospital for the 
Insane</I><A HREF="#notes"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>&#0134;</SUP></FONT></A> in Nashville, Davidson County, 
Tennessee, and there he died.
The Tennessee Mortality Schedule of 1880 shows that William Smoot, age 
59,<A HREF="#two"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>&#0135;</SUP></FONT></A> died at the hospital 
during December 1879 of chronic phthisis (tuberculosis). His death is also confirmed by the Estate 
Administration (below). It is probable that 
William was buried at the hospital in Nashville, his body not being returned to Warren 
County for burial. Most 
if not all old time gravemarkers at the hospital are now lost. William Smoot&#0146;s wife, 
Matilda Anderson Smoot is buried at the Old Philadelphia Cemetery in Vervilla, 
Warren County Tennessee. At her graveside is an unused plot, apparently still waiting for William.

<A NAME="notes">Notes:<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#0134;&nbsp; The <I>Tennessee Hospital for the 
Insane</I> became known as <I>Central State Hospital</I> and is now known 
as <i>Middle Tennessee Mental Health Institute</I>. Back in 1879, it 
would be found in Davidson County&#0146;s 5<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>th</SUP></FONT> 
Civil District on the Murfreesboro Pike. In the past, the hospital had been a 
poor custodian of its records and its graveyards. <BR><BR>

<A NAME="two">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#0135;&nbsp; The age given on the 1880 Mortality Schedule, 59, is 
probably not accurate. His age as given on the 1850, 1860, and 1870 censuses are 
all different. An old family record show William born 6 Sep 1816.<BR><BR>

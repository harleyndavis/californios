This land is located on the south side of the Barren Fork River, 
across the river from Crisp. The present day intersection of 
Old Shelbyville Road and Old Well Road are on the original 
tract. An &#0147;Anderson Cemetery&#0148; is located on the 
southeast portion of this tract; now just the foundation of 
a Tennessee grave house remain. There are no visible headstones. 
James Anderson and his wife Elizabeth died in 1846. Family tradition 
names the wife of James as Elizabeth Smoot. James was an older 
brother (or half brother) of Matilda Anderson, wife of William 
Smoot. One child of James and Elizabeth was named Daniel Smoot 
Anderson.

<DD>This Bible is believed to be now destroyed. 
These recordings presented here are from the notes, taken directly from the original 
Bible by 
Jane Wingo Smoot of Manchester, Coffee Co. Jane&#0146;s husband is Ralph Smoot, a 
direct descendant of William and Matilda Smoot. <BR>

<DD>The Bible had been maintain in the Smoot home on Old Shelbyville Road in southwest 
Warren County for well over a hundred years. 
It was removed from the Smoot home by a family member. <BR>

<DD>In 1968, Jane and two of Ralph&#0146;s brothers visited the new home of the Bible. Jane 
was allowed to copy the inscriptions. 
What is presented here are the notes made by Jane. In 1992, Jane allowed me to copy her 
notes. 
<DD>The following year, on a return visit, I checked my copy against her notes and we 
discussed her date entries and a question over the middle name of Sophia Smoot. 
Jane said she converted many of the dates to all numbers, so as to finish the job quickly. 
I will convert the dates back to original form. My notes will be in brackets [ ].

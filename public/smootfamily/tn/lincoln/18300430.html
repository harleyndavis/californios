1. On  2 April 1832 John B. Smoot deeds four and one half (4&#0189;) acres to &#0147;Hogue and Mason.&#0148; This 
tract adjoins Hogue and Mason&#0146;s corner, the Wm F. Smith line, and Henry Warren&#0146;s northeast corner and 
so states &#0147;whereon my Tan Yard now stands.&#0148; The witnesses were Wm F. Smith, Webb K. Jennings, and John 
Garner [?]. Registered 28 May 1833. <BR>
(Lincoln County Tennessee Deed Book &#0147;I&#0148; page 519.) <BR><BR>

2. Here are some comments about John B. Smoot&#0146;s wife Sarah Jennings, from my good friend, Mrs. Betty M. 
Majors of Tullahoma, Tennessee, dated 10 Jun 1993.  <BR><BR>

&#0147;... Interestingly, the witness on the shorter [1832] deed is Webb K. Jennings, who was John B. 
Smoot&#0146;s wife&#0146;s brother. John B. Smoot and Sarah Jennings were married 10 Jan 1824 in Lincoln 
County Tennessee . Sarah married secondly to______ Williamson, and is buried next to this second husband 
in Harpersville Churchyard in Harpersville, Shelby County, Alabama. She was the daughter of William Jennings 
who died in 1840 in Shelby County, Alabama and his wife Polly Kidd. Wm Jennings was the son of Robert and 
Rachel (Patterson)
Jennings. Polly Kidd was the daughter of Webb and Elizabeth (White) Kidd. Elizabeth White was the daughter 
of Jeremiah and Mary (Martin) White and granddaughter of Peter and Mary (Keeble) White and John and Martha 
(Brumwell) Martin...&#0148;<BR><BR> 


3. <B>John B. Smoot</B> is listed in <I>The Village Messenger</I>, Fayetteville, Tennessee, Vol. II, 
No. 5, April 7, 1824; <BR> &#0147;Remaining in the Post Office in Fayetteville, T. on the 
31<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>st</SUP></FONT>  of March, 1824, which if not taken out before 
the 1<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>st</SUP></FONT>  of July next will be sent to the General P. Office as dead letters. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  March 31, 1824 <BR><BR>

4. A John B. Smoote is enumerated in the 1830 U. S. Federal Census for Lincoln County Tennessee.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  001001 - 000001 <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  One male, 10-15, one male, 30-40, one female, 30-40. <BR><BR>

5. Northeastern Lincoln County including that area of Lincoln County which became Moore 
County in 1871 was known for its excellent hunting. A tannery then would have been a fitting business 
for that area. The East and West Forks of Mulberry Creek are found in both Moore and Lincoln Counties.
Mulberry Creek itself is found in Lincoln County. There is today a Tanyard Hill Road which runs southeast from 
Lynchburg, the Moore County seat.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the realm conjecture, I offer that the John B. Smoot on the above deed 
may be the same John B. Smoot as found as a witness on 
this <A HREF="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/va/pittsylvania/18140219.html">1814 deed</A> Pittsylvania 
County Virginia. That tract of land included a tannery. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often in the old deeds, we see a 
person sold, but without reference to their race. 
The assumption is that the person was Black. While this is probably 
a fair assumption, we must not overlook the possibility 
the slave could also be part White, part Indian, or both. In the Carolinas prior to 
1717, enslavement of Indians (Yamasee and others)
was done regularly.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terms Negro, Black, African, Slaves, and Black African are the 
words we find in the old censuses, documents, literature, letters, and common American speech. It would seem 
that the terms African American and Afro-American are more modern constructions.   <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amerindian and Native American are also more modern constructions. 
The term Indian is the old form, some say it derived from the fact that Columbus was eight thousand mile off in his 
mathematical calculations and thought he was in East Indies.   <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many words in America&#0146;s history and the history of the Americas 
that have been used to identify, disguise, categorize, control, or to segregate People of Color. 
Here are some of those words. 

<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Black Dutch :</FONT> <BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably, originally White Europeans with pure black 
features (hair). This term has also been applied to persons with mixed racial heritage. This term may 
have had different meanings to different people. It also may have been used by some to disguise their racial 
heritage. There is no 
definitive answer to the question of &#0147;who are the Black Dutch?&#0148; <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Blood Quantum :</FONT> <BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This term is used to identify the percentage or quantity of 
Indian Blood that a person has. Today, in order to qualify for tribal membership in certain tribes, especially 
the federally recognized tribes, there are Blood Quantum requirements. The Blood Quantum requirements 
vary from tribe to tribe.   <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Breed, Breeds :</FONT> <BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This term is applied mainly to Indians of mixed blood. See Half Breed.  <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Californios :</FONT> <BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A term applied to the first wave of Spanish explorers, priests, and 
soldiers who came to California in 1769 and later. In that vanguard, the soldiers were the ones most likely to have mixed 
blood, i.e., Mexican Indian, and potentially a small amount of Sepharic Jew, crypto-Moor, or even Gypsy blood. 
<I>Californios</I> refers to both a people and a culture. Today, descendents of the those early Californios proudly 
claim their heritage. 

<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Free Issue, Free Issue Negro :</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Negro or mixed-race person free by manumission or birth; 
especially the child of a White woman and a Negro man. Commonly used in Virginia and the Carolinas.   <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Free Man of Color (F.M.C.), Free Person(s) of Color, Free Woman of 
Color (F.W.C.), etc. (Used especially in Louisiana. Seen on some US Censuses.) :  </FONT> <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person with mixed ancestry, not a slave, often a mixture of Negro and 
White, i.e., mulatto, quadroon, or octoroon. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A darker skinned person, not a slave and not considered Negro, 
usually of Mediterranean, near east, East Indian, or Asian origins. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Also applied to Native Americans. <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Free Mixture :</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably a person, not a slave, being part Black, and being part 
White and/or Indian.  <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Griff, Griffe, Griffane, Griffin :</FONT> <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offspring of a White and a Black. Used especially in Louisiana.   <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Half and Half :</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person of mixed blood; a half breed. Part Indian or part Black.   <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Half Breed, Half Blood, Half Blooded :</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child of an Indian and a White parent. May be applied to people 
who are part Black.  <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">High Yellow (often pronounced, high yalla or high yaller): </FONT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A light-skinned Negro person. As some say, &#0147;mostly White.&#0148;  <BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Marabou :</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person having five eighths Negro blood; the offspring of a mulatto 
and a griffe. Usage found in Louisiana. <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Maroon :</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For our purposes, a fugitive or runaway slave, one who joined with the 
Seminole in Florida. Earlier, this word was applied to fugitive Negro slaves in the West Indies and Dutch 
Guiana. Interestingly, the word origins of Maroon in this usage is from certain Spanish words: <I>symeron</I>, > 
<I>cimarron</I>, > <I>cimarrón</I>, meaning wild, free, a runaway person. It is possible that the term maroon may have 
been misapplied as a color. Maroon is a very dark brownish-red or chestnut color.  <BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Marranos :</FONT> <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sephardic Jews (Jews of Spain and Portugal) who went through a 
conversion process (usually forced or by necessity) to Catholicism during the Spanish/Portuguese Inquisition and 
so became <I>conversos</I>, a.k.a., <I>Marranos</I>. Many of these people fled the Inquisition by coming to the colonial 
Americas, especially Mexico and southward. They would have come as sailors, soldiers, and settlers.  Today, we would 
expect to find descendants in the American southwest.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Sephardic Jews came to British colonial America, 
but in fewer numbers; these people often would flee to France or England and then 
sail the America&#0146;s east coast. <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Melungeon :</FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person of mixed racial heritage. Common usage in East Tennessee. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the latest DNA 
study (20 June 2002)  by Dr. Kevin
Jones, a biologist at the University of Virginia&#0146;s College at Wise, as reported by the 
Melungeon Heritage Association: &#0147;While the Melungeons are predominantly European in 
their genetic backgrounds,
they are indeed tri-racial. &#0145;The[re] appears to be a small percentage of both Native 
American and African-American sequences in there, too,&#0146; Jones stated, &#0145;although 
they are certainly both in the minority . . .&#0146; &#0148; Additionally the report stated, 
&#0147;New questions have been raised, however, concerning females potentially from Turkey and 
northern India who are a part of the Melungeon ancestry.&#0148; <BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Donald Panther-Yates of <I>Georgia Southern University</I> posted 
his response to 
the recent Jones DNA study to RootsWeb&#0146;s AMERIND-US-SE mailing list. Here is part of that response: <BR> 
<FONT COLOR="#0000BB">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the point about why study mDNA if they 
were all male founders, Jones and Kennedy did discover one interesting  
finding by studying the female lines:  there was a small contribution 
of Siddi or  Roma (Gypsy). This was interpreted to 
indicate that the Melungeon base population came over to this country 
already in family units! I believe they drew the right 
conclusion but missed the ethnicity of those family units--they were 
Sephardic Jewish. Only medieval Spain unified all the 
strains that are emerging as &#0147;Melungeon&#0148;--Moorish, Arabic, 
Turkish, Portuguese, Jewish, Gypsy (they came 
with  the Moslem conquerors from Iran), Spanish, Morrocan, etc. Only the 
expulsion of the Jews in 1492 and later can adequately 
explain the movements and reassembly of &#0147;Melungeons.&#0148; Only 
Judaism can provide motivation and &#0147;Occam&#0146;s 
razor&#0148; (simplest explanation) for cousin marriage and secrecy, 
generation after generation.</FONT>   <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Mestizo :</FONT> <BR>
(From <I>Webster&#0146;s Dictionary</I>)<BR> <FONT COLOR="#0000BB">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. a person of mixed blood. 2. (in Spanish America) a person 
of Spanish and Amerindian blood. 3. a person of European and East 
Indian blood. 4. a person who is of Philippine and foreign ancestry. Also <I>referring to a 
woman</I>, <B>mestiza</B>. </FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Moriscos :</FONT> <BR>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslims (of Spain) who went through a conversion process 
(usually forced or by necessity) to Catholicism during the Spanish Inquisition and so became 
<I>conversos</I>, a.k.a., <I> Moriscos</I>. These people are the descendants of the Moors who 
invaded Spain in 711 A.D.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the Marranos, the Moriscos are part of the great 
melting pot of the Americas. 
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Mulatto :</FONT> <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who is one-half Negro, one-half White. The child of 
one White parent and one Negro parent. From the Spanish and Portuguese word <I>mulato</I> meaning young mule. 
The mule is of course, one half horse and one half donkey, a hybrid. In Brazil, the term <I>Cafuzo</I> is 
used to describe a half Indian, half Negro person. <BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Negra, Nigra, Niggra : </FONT> <BR>
(From <I>Dictionary of American Regional English</I>, Vol III)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#0000BB">A Black Person. </FONT><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Editors Note : </FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be possible that the term Nigra started because of the southern 
speech pattern (southern drawl) where Negro is pronounced <I>Nigruh</I>, however it has the flavor of being 
feminine, in the way Spanish use the &#0147;a&#0148; as a word ending to imply the feminine. Today this is considered a 
derogatory term. If a White southerner said, &#0147;It is the White man&#0146;s duty to take care of the 
Nigras&#0148; the demeaning qualities of that statement are apparent.


<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Negro, nager, neeger, negra, nig, nigro, &#038;c. : </FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negro, a Spanish word meaning black. There are a number of early variant spellings 
of Negro. From John Smith&#0146;s <I>General History of Virginia</I>, 1624. <FONT COLOR="#0000BB">&#0147;About 
the last of August came in a dutch man of warre that sold vs twenty negars.&#0148;</FONT> -- 
and so started the slave trade in British America.  <BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000BB">Octoroon, (also mestee, mustee) : </FONT> <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who is one-eighth Negro, seven-eighths White. The child of one 
White parent and a quadroon. From the Latin word <I>octo</I> meaning eight.  <BR><BR>

<DD>The work on this page was extracted by Carole Hammett from the IGI (International Genealogical Index) 
through the online Family Search website search

<DD>Because of Carole&#0146;s illness, I am now checking, reformatting, and also coding her work. This page should 
unquestionably be 
considered <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>&#0147;Under Construction.&#0148;</B></FONT> <BR>
<DD>The purpose of this work is to show that there are enough <U>English</U> Smout (Smoute, Smooth, &#038;c.) 
records to demonstrate by statistical probability that &#0147;William Smute, Boatright of Hampton, Virginia, and 
Pickawaxon, Maryland,&#0148; may well be directly connected to the English Smouts. We do understand that there 
are many spelling variations of the Smout surname. That is so because in those old days, more were hooked 
on phonics than on spelling.  <BR>
<DD>We do not deny that in the realm of possibilities, there could be a &#0147;continental connection&#0148; 
(as strongly suggested by Harry Wright Newman) to 
the Smute and Smout names/lines, but in any case, those connections <B><I>have not been proven!</I></B> <BR> </DIV>

St. Dunstan, Stepney, was (before the administrative reorganization of 1979) in the shire of Middlesex, 
but in that part which was a suburb of London (and today parter of the administrative entity 
called Greater London). There were many mariners residing in this area, thus not at all impossible 
that boatbuilders might have been here also. </FONT><BR><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A general public mail list has been created by Rootsweb called SMOOT.  This
list is open to all interested parties, but by subscription only. 
No one will be able to post to the list unless they are subscribed to it. 
This way, advertisers will not be able to &#0147spam&#0148 the list.<BR><BR>

We encourage your posting of your family lines, asking questions about historic events, 
and posting documented  information such as wills, Bible records and just 
about anything that would fit in the realm of Smoot family genealogy. 
Subscribers who post non genealogical 
messages will be gently reminded of our policy. Subscribers who persist in posting non 
genealogical messages may be removed from the list and if necessary have their e-mail 
addresses blocked so they may not re-subscribe.<BR><BR>

<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100"><BR>

You may subscribe to the SMOOT list in mail mode by sending a message
to <a href="mailto:SMOOT-L-request@rootsweb.com">
SMOOT-L-request@rootsweb.com</A><BR>

In the message window (body of the message), it should only contain the 
word:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000BB"><DD><H2>subscribe</H2></FONT>
No other words should be in the message window. Any &#0147sig lines&#0148 should
also be removed from the window.<BR><BR>

<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100"><BR>

Or, you may subscribe to the DIGEST mode, where about twenty posts are
grouped together and then sent to the subscribers. Digests produce less
clutter in your mailbox, but replying to an individual message may
require a little extra effort.<BR><BR>

If you prefer to subscribe to the digest mode, you should send the
command instead to 
<a href="mailto:SMOOT-D-request@rootsweb.com">
SMOOT-D-request@rootsweb.com</A><BR>
and of course, the word:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000BB"><DD><H2>subscribe</H2></FONT>

No other words should be in the message window. Any &#0147sig lines&#0148 should
also be removed from the window.<BR><BR>
<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100"><BR>

You may unsubscribe to the SMOOT list by sending a message
to <a href="mailto:SMOOT-L-request@rootsweb.com">
SMOOT-L-request@rootsweb.com</A><BR>

In the message window (body of the message), it should only contain the 
word:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000BB"><DD><H2>unsubscribe</H2></FONT>

No other words should be in the message window. Any &#0147sig lines&#0148 should
also be removed from the window.<BR><BR>
<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100"><BR>
Once you are subscribed, use this address when posting to the list:<BR><BR> 
<DD>
<FONT COLOR="#C04000"><B>SMOOT-L@rootsweb.com</B></FONT><BR><BR>

Do <B>not</B> attach files to your e-mail. Rootsweb&#0146s system will not allow 
attached files to pass through their system. This way you will not receive a file with a 
virus. Do not &#0147forward&#0148 e-mail with your message. Rather, copy the text 
into your new message. Send only plain text e-mail, 
HTML coded e-mail will be rejected by RootsWeb&#0146s servers.<BR><BR>

<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100"><BR>
The business of this list is SMOOT Family genealogy. As stated above, you are encouraged to publish
questions on you family lines. If you submit a question to this list,
please place the surnames in the subject line of your e-mail. Like this:<BR><BR>

<DD><B>SMOOT, SMUTE</B><BR><BR>

This will allow future researchers to find your query in the mailing
list archives maintained by Rootsweb.<BR><BR>

Guidelines</H2></FONT></CENTER>
You folks that have self published genealogy books that are relevant to the focus of this 
list, may announce those books on this list, however, please keep the business 
transactions private. There is NO need to have those  transactions archived on 
Rootsweb.<BR><BR>

We do not warrantee any business transaction that you might make from this list.

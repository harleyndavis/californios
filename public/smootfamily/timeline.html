&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lamoral, Count of Egmont, Prince of G&#0226;vre, 
and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn were beheaded at Brussels, 5 June 1568. 
Both men had been declared guilty of high treason and condemned to death by the Conseil 
des Troubles, a court established by the Duke of Alva. The beheading of the two men 
was one of the principal grievances of the Low Countries against the Catholic Government 
of the Spanish Netherlands, caused great public outrage, and marked the 
beginning of the open revolt against the Spanish. </DIV></FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#0147;All the world&#0146;s a stage, and all 
the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts . . . 
&#0148;<A HREF="#players"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>&#0134;</SUP></FONT></A>
If so, then our ancestors played their parts against the backdrop 
of history, and it was the major historical events that directed them through time. <BR> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time is conveniently divided into time 
periods<A HREF="#time"><FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>&#0135;</SUP></FONT></A> 
which of course are fictional divisions used by historians to keep their filing cabinets orderly.
They put titles on the time periods as playwrights 
number their acts. Some might say that our selected 
time period comes near the end of the Renaissance and runs into the Early 
Modern period. From our view, 1450 to 1715 was simply a period of significant changes in Europe 
and great upheaval in the Americas.  
The discovery of the Americas, along with the plundering of some of the First American 
Nations (Aztec, Inca, &#038;c.) brought considerable wealth to Catholic Spain. This wealth 
allowed Spain to continue its dreaded Inquisition and even more importantly, the use of 
the stolen gold to maintain armies and oppose the struggling Protestant Reformation. The 
Inquisition existed long before it was adopted by Catholic Spain, however it was the Spanish 
Inquisition that became the pinnacle of terror.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Protestant Reformation grew 
and so great wars accompanied by religious persecution spread across northern Europe, 
(England, Scotland, Netherlands, France, Western Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, parts of 
Poland and even Spain). Torture and executions became the rule rather than the exception. 
This bloodletting compelled many common Protestant folk to flee to England 
often directly from the Dutch lowlands. In England and Ireland, the Catholics were in 
opposition to the Protestant Crown and so they too were persecuted. In the late 1500s, 
most folk 
from the European mainland first settled in London and that city 
was well known for its extreme filthy conditions. 
Over population and poverty were commonplace. There soon followed an 
exodus from England to British America. Starting with a few souls, that 
exodus soon became an avalanche. 

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overwhelming migration to 
America had a profound negative 
impact on Native Americans and of course, on the Black Africans (and others) who were 
imported as slave labor. While our list shows the big picture, every person who 
migrated to America was part of that picture, as were America&#0146;s 
First People and those who were enslaved there. Many were bit players,  
while some were leading actors -- yet all were players.    <BR><BR>

                number of these Scots (or their descendants) migrated to 
                America, where they came to be known as the Scots-Irish.

1664 ---------- Dutchman Peter Stuyvesant surrenders New Amsterdam 
                (Manhatten) to the English. In 1667, the peace 
                commissioners proposed that Dutch keep the island of Run 
                in the East Indies - along with its nutmeg - and the 
                English keep Manhatten. 
1665 ---------- A Royal Charter is granted for the creation of the 
                Proprietorship of Carolina in the British American Colonies.

                end the War of Devolution against Spain.
1669 ---------- Last diet of the Hanseatic League is held. The Hansa was a  
                mercantile league of medieval German towns. In medieval times, 
                the Hansa or guild of merchants joined together to promote 
                and protect trading privileges. The league was militarily 
                active until 1441 when it was defeated by the Dutch. The 
                league was never formally dissolved. Today, German cities 
                of Lübeck, Hamburg, and Bremen are known as Hanseatic cities.
1670 ---------- Hudson's Bay Company chartered in London by King Charles II. 
1673 ---------- James Needham and Gabriel Arthur entered Cherokee country as 
                far as Chota, on the Little Tennessee River. Arthur traveled 
                with the Cherokee through the Cumberland Gap, north following 
                the western branch of the Warrior's path, into Ohio and back 
                again.
1689 ---------- In England, a Bill of Rights was adopted that would redefine
                the relationship between the monarchy and subjects. This Bill
                of Rights defined the authority of Parliament.
1693 ---------- Williamite Plantation. The Plantations of Ireland, the 
                Ulster, Cromwellian, and Williamite, had lasted almost a 
                century. In 1603, about 95% of land in Ireland was owned by 
                Catholics. It is said that by the close of the 1600s, "more 
                than 81% of the productive land was confiscated from the 
                predominantly Catholic native Irish, and handed over to 
                Protestant settlers from primarily Scotland and England." 
1696 ---------- Spain establishes Pensacola Flordia.
1698 ---------- The "Company of Scotland" (Scottish East India Company)

                government moves to "Middle Plantation" and Williamsburg 
                comes into being there.
1700 ---------- One hundred and twenty French Huguenots (Protestants) settle 
                on the western Virginia frontier. Their settlement was known 
                as Manakin Town.  
1701-1714 ----- War of the Spanish Succession, last of the general European 
                wars caused by the efforts of King Louis XIV to extend 
                French power.
1702-1713------ Queen Anne's War corresponds to the War of the Spanish 
                Succession. The American frontier was the scene of many 
                bloody battles; the French and Native American 1704 raid 
                on Deerfield, Massachusetts was especially notable. The 
                French and Indians burned much of the town, killed numerous
                people, and took the captives back to Canada. 
1711-1713 ----- Tuscarora War on North Carolina frontier fought between British
                settlers and Tuscarora Indians. Remnants of this Iroquoian 
                tribe migrate north.
1712 ---------- Englishman Thomas Newcomen, inventor of the first commercial
                steam engine, uses his engine to pump water from a coal 
                mine.
1714 ---------- A Cherokee-Chickasaw alliance force the Shawnee from 
                Tennessee and Cumberland River basins northward beyond the 
                Ohio River.
1714 ---------- Forty-two Germans from the town of Siegen and Muesen in the 
                principality of Nassau-Siegen settle at what would be called
                Fort Germanna, Virginia. 
1715 ---------- The Yamasee War in Carolina begins, involving the Apalachee, 
                Creek, Sarraw, Savannah, and Yamasee against the white 
                traders and settlers. In June, Carolina forces under Governor 
                Craven defeated the Yamasee at Salkiehatchen and driven back 
                into Florida, where they allied themselves with the Spaniards. 
                The Yamasee captives of the English colonists were shipped 
                to the slave markets in the West Indies. Escaping Yamasee 
                fled south into Spanish Florida. There the Yamasee and Lower 
                Creek continued the struggle along the border. In Carolina, 
                the Upper Creek also continued their attack, almost taking 
                Charles Town. 
                The Cherokee, a traditional enemy of the Creek, had been at 
                the periphery of this war. When asked by the Creek to help 
                them, the Cherokee instead sided with the British, thus 
                weakening the Creek position. 
                In 1717, a peace treaty was reached.</PRE>

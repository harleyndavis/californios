&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Will of Samuel Maddox, immigrant (ca 1640 -1684)  
is an early connection between the Maddox and Smoot families. 
There are other connections, though sometimes just peripheral involvments with land 
and witnesses. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is some conjecture that Eleanor ___, mother of one Thomas Smoot (1742-1783), may 
be a Maddox. Unfortunately, we have yet to see any definitive documented proof that substantiates that conjecture.

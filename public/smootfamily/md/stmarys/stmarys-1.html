According to Newman, Grace ATWICK later married Thomas HINTON, and was referred to &#0147;by some of the children 
as &#0146;sister.&#0146; His source for this is not yet known. Newman further states that Grace and James ATWICK were 
transported into Virginia by John DORMAN, of
Northampton County, who demanded land in 1655, and that &#0147;It is therefore a question whether she was born 
Grace WOOD or Grace SMOOT.&#0148; He further states that Grace &#0147;came into Maryland at a later date through the 
activities of John WAGHOP who transported her, her husband, and children--William and Jeane ATWICKES&#0148; [sic] 
(these records not yet located either).

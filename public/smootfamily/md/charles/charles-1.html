<DD>Charles County, Province of Maryland was established in 1658 from St. Mary&#0146;s County. 
The first known Smoots (including all variant spellings) recorded in what would become 
Charles County are the family of &#0147;William the Boatright&#0148; who came to Maryland in 1646 
from 
<a href="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/va/york/16420204.htm">York County, Virginia</a>, claiming 
headrights (at 50 acres per &#0147;head&#0148;) for having transported eight individuals, including himself:  (See also

(to side in different handwriting is written Atwicks Purchase) (FHL microfilm 13064, MD patents, Liber 
ABH (Vol. 4) extracted by Fredric Z. Saunders)
<BR><BR>

The information is somewhat ambiguous, but it appears to likely be but one William Smoot. 
The 13 Nov. 1652 record shows that the William who received the 300 acre tract on Herring Creek (&#0147;Smoot&#0148;), 
and the 400 acre tract on the Wiccohomico River (&#0147;Atwicks Purchase&#0148;) were the same person.  The patent for 
the 400 acre &#0147;Atwicks Purchase&#0148; shows this was for transportation of his wife and 3 daughters.  The warrant 
for &#0147;Smoote&#0148; was listed for transportation of himself, wife, and two children.  He would have been entitled 
to 400 acres here, but only received a patent on 300 acres (presumably for himself and two sons), thus using 
his wife&#0146;s transportation later on &#0147;Atwicks Purchase.&#0148; What is confusing is the 4 June 1649 warrant for 
100 acres 
for transportation of himself and two children.  If this is a different William Smoot, he should have been 
entitled to 300 acres, not 100 acres. If this is the same William Smoot, he shouldn&#0146;t have been entitled to 
any land, as he had already received the 300 acre &#0147;Smoote&#0148; for those threes transportation. The only 
explanation 
I can figure is that he was trying to get the additional 100 acres that he didn&#0146;t get when he got only a 300 acre 
patent, for transportation of himself, wife and two children, when he was entitled to 400 acres.  Technically then 
the warrant should have only mentioned transportation of one person, not three.  Although there is the warrant, 
I don&#0146;t find a patent for this 100 acres.  It would appear  he didn&#0146;t follow through on this, and decided 
then to 
transfer his wife&#0146;s transportation to the 400 acre &#0147;Atwicks Purchase.&#0148;

No mention of land claimed for his wife&#0146;s daughter Elizabeth Wood, and servant Ann Woodnot.  
There is the mention of 50 acres being assinged to Thomas Bushnell, possibly he assigned the 
rights of the other 150 acres, also.<BR><BR>

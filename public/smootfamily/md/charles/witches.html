<DD>Unquestionably the wife of John Hatch, one of Governor Fen
 dali&#0146;s Council, had brought abuseful reproaches upon Joan, his wife, in having
 declared that Goodie Mitchell had bewitched her face so that &#0147;<FONT COLOR="#0000BB">shee endureth
 abundance of Misery by the soarness of her mouth ...</FONT>&#0148; and two depositions were
 filed attesting to the fact that Mrs. Hatch had spread such evil reports. The
 matter seems to have been dropped, however, until nearly two years later when
 at the September 24, 1661, at court, Joan Mitchell, now a widow, brought suits
 for defamation against four prominent residents of Charles County, including
 Francis. Doughtie, the minister, for having &#0147;<FONT COLOR="#0000BB">raysed schandalous reports of
 mee . . . that I salluted a woman at church and her teeth fell a Acking as if
 shee had been mad.</FONT>&#0148; It was also testified that Mrs. Long, one of the others
 sued for defamation, had said that &#0147;<FONT COLOR="#0000BB">the hene and Chickens that she had of
 Goodie Mitchell ... did die in such a strang manner that she thaught sum
 old witch or other had bewitched them</FONT>&#0148; (pp. 54-55, 139, 142, 144-145, 155,
 156).

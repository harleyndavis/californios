<dd>The earliest record of Smootes in Maryland is in 1646, the family of William SMOOTE the boatright 
who was earlier of <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/va/york/16420204.htm">York County, Virginia</a> 
(about whom Robert BOUTH of York told the court in December 1646, he is &#0147;gon out of the collony to Maryland&#0148;). 
Because two separate records for headright claims exist for a William SMOOTE and family in 1646, one question 
facing Smoot researchers has been whether there was one William or two. 

<BR><BR>

The system of headrights was initiated by Cecilius Calvert, Second Lord Baltimore and 
Proprietor of Maryland, to encourage emigration to Maryland. Each &#0147;head&#0148; (individual) 
transported to Maryland earned one the &#0147;right&#0148; to 50 acres of land. Owning a headright, 
however, was not the same as owning 50 acres since headrights could be assigned to others. 
For those with headrights, the three three steps were involved: (1) A warrant for a survey; 
(2) a surveyor&#0146;s certificate; and (3) a land patent. The records of Maryland show that 
William SMOOTE both assigned (sold) and purchased headrights in addition to applying his own 
headrights:

<blockquote>

1, Ref: AB&H 230, 243: <B>William SMOOTE(S)</B>: 9 headrights: self, wife Grace, sons Thomas and Richard SMOOTE; 
daughters Ales, Ann and Elizabeth SMOOTE; his wife&#0146;s daughter, Elizabeth WOOD; and servant Ann WOODNOT.

and Virginia</i>, Harry Wright Newman (hereinafter <i>Newman</i>, 
<a href="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/book/001.html">page 3</a>)

</blockquote>

The first record is believed to have been the William SMOOTE who is recorded in 
<a href="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/va/york/">York County, Virginia</a> on 22 
Dec 1646 as &#0147;gon out of the Collony to Maryland.&#0148; These eight transports (headrights) 
rendered William SMOOTE eligible for 400 acres of land which <i>may</i> have been the 
tract in 
<a href="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/md/charles/charles-1.html">Charles County</a> described 
on 22 May 1675 as at the head of Smooth branch on the 
western side of the Wiccocomico River, and granted to William SMOOTE on 26 Jan 1652 (See also, however, 
1665 below). The second William SMOOT record <i>may</i> have been William&#0146;s son, and <i>may</i> have been 
applied to a 300 acre tract named &#0147;Smoote&#0148; near the mouth of Herring Creek in New Town Manor, 
<a href="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/md/stmarys/">St. Mary&#0146;s County</a>. 

<blockquote>

<b>William SMOOTE</B>, rights assigned by him in 1665: <B>Will. SMOOTE, Grace SMOOTE, Alce SMOOTE</B>, 
Anna COOPER, George GILBERT, Bartholomew WELLS, & Alce BROWNE (<i>Gibbs</i>, CC:642, 695 Film No.: SR 8201; 
Transcript. 7:577, 620 [SR 7349]; MSA SC 4341-4199)

</blockquote>

According to <i>Newman</i>, page 4, in 1665 William SMOOTE &#0147;transported seven persons into Maryland for 
which he was granted 350 acres of land, and later an additional six persons for which he received 300 acres. 
The latter he assigned to Richard Morris.&#0148; The index entry for the second record has not yet been obtained, 
nor either record viewed, but it appears that in the case of the above record at least, that duplicate 
claims were made for transport of the same individuals (unless William SMOOTE left Maryland in betwixt and 
later returned - again, research is in progress, with many more records still to be reviewed).

If these are the same couple, then again, duplicate claims were made for transport (assuming, again, 
that 
they did not leave the Province, only to return later). According to 
<i>Newman</i>, <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/book/006.html">page 7</a>, 
&#0147;a warrant on September 26, 1673, was issued to him [Richard] for 200 acres of land, 100 
acres of which was due for &#0147;time of service of himself and wife Elizabeth performed in the 
Province...&#0148; Newman makes no mention of the 1668 record, but adds that the second hundred acres 
were &#0147;from assignment of Thomas NOTLEY, due the latter for the transporting of John REED and 
Robert COLLINGSWOOD...&#0148;

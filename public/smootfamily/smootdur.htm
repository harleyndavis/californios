<DD>One of the many perplexing problems that arise in the study of Smoot family 
genealogy is the of the relationship between Dorothy Durham (b ca 1663) and William 
Smoot. Genealogies that have been recently published have placed Dorothy as the 
daughter of William Smoot. Modern competent researchers have questioned that 
relationship, and some believe that Dorothy Durham may have been born a Gilbert, not 
a Smoot. This page will present both documentation and dialog about that subject 
which has appeared on our SMOOT-L mailing list. </FONT>
<BR><BR>
<Font Color="#4B0082">
<DD>This discussion starts with two messages regarding a Smoot and Veale family 
connection, then on the third message the Durham question is added. As is usual with 
e-mail messages, you will find that the subject matter will meander like a crooked creek. 
Future messages will probably make a few more changes in direction, and so, we 
apologize for that.

<CENTER><B>[SMOOT-L] Smoot, William died 1707 Westmoreland Co. VA (Part 1)
</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
Hi, <BR><BR>

<DD>This e-mail will consist of two separate postings.  This first part will add to what has appeared in print about William Smoot.  The second part will be some conjecture in light of new information.<BR><BR>

<DD>This will draw on three published works dealing with the Smoot family.  All got parts regarding rights William Smoot and contained information the other two did not, but all had either errors or incomplete information.  These three works are: <BR><BR>
<DD><I>The Smoots of Maryland and Virginia,</I> by Harry Wright Newman<BR><BR>

<DD><I>The Price, Blackemore, Hamblen, Skipworth and Allied Lines,</I> by Mayor Jay Berry Price (Knoxville, TN: Tenn. Valley Publishing, 1992) <BR><BR>

<DD><I>Early Families of Southern Maryland,</I> Vol 5, by Elise Greenup Jourdan<BR><BR>

<DD>From clues provided by these works, plus research of the records mine, I hope to provide a clearer of the family of this William Smoot. <BR><BR>

<DD>William Smoot wrote his will in Westmoreland Co., VA on 23 Apr. 1706, proved 30 
Apr. 1707.  He named his wife Eleanor, daughters Sarah, Winifred, and Mary. Sons William and Thomas at age 21. <BR><BR>

<DD>Price was the first and only to note that William's wife was Eleanor Veale, daughter of Morris Veale and wife Dorothy.  She was named as Eleanor Veale in her father's 1696 will.  On 23 Feb. 1697/8 she received 80 pounds of tobacco for two days attendance at court to prove the will of Jeremia Jadwin. (Westmoreland Co., VA Order Bk. 1690-1698, p. 256a, abstracted by John Frederick Dorman)  She had married by Dec. 1699 when John Tanner filed an information for perjury against Thomas Wilson and Ellenor Smoot. On 26 June 1700 the sheriff was ordered to bring Thomas Wilson and Ellenor Veale, now Elleanor Smoot to the next court to answer for perjury exhibited against them by John Tanner. (Westmoreland Co., VA  Order Bk. 1698-1705, p. 85a, abstracted by Dorman)  On 29 Aug. 1700 Ellenor Smoot late Ellenor Veale was in court regarding the charges (p. 92). <BR><BR>

<DD>As shown later, records indicate William had a son John born after his will was written.  Newman believed that from the will "it would seem to indicate that his three daughters had obtained majority and therefore could easily be of the first union.  His sons, being minors at death, could possibly be of his second wife."   My interpretation of the will in conjunction with other records is exactly the opposite.  I believe that William and Thomas were children of his first marriage, and the 3 daughters were children by Eleanor Veale. <BR><BR>

<DD>In his will, William stated that his wife Ellinor to have the care and tuition of two sons William and Thomas until age 21.  I believe this statement was because they were children of his first wife.  Had he not desired for Elenor to have the care of them, they not being her sons, it would not have been at all unusual for them to be placed under the care of someone else.  As his daughters were children of Eleanor, he saw no need to make a statement regarding their care.  Also, Eleanor in her will made no mention of her supposed son William or his children,  while she did mention make bequests to the daughters and/or children by them, and call them grandchildren.  From these facts, I can only conclude that William and Thomas are children by the first wife Anne, and the three daughters and John are children by Eleanor Veale. <BR><BR>

<DD>Eleanor had apparently not remarried yet when on 26 Jan. 1708/9 "Elizabeth (sic) Smoot confessed judgement to Thomas Marson for 700 pounds of tobacco due by Wm. Smoot her deceased husband" (Westmoreland Co., VA Order Bk. 1705-1721, p. 107 abstrated by Dorman).  This case was continued, and she had married William Trigg by 28 Aug. 1712 when judgement was  given to Thomas Marson against William Trigg and Ellenor his wife. (1705-1721 Bk., p. 196a abstracted by Dorman). <BR><BR>

<DD>William's son William was of age on 1 Oct. 1713 to testify in a suit Augustine Higgins brought agains John Veale (Eleanor's brother). (1705-1721 Order Bk., p. 267 abstracted by Dorman).  Also testifying in the suit was William Trigg (Eleanor's husband). <BR><BR>

<DD>On 26 Sep. 1717 Mary Smoot, orphan of Wm. Smoot chose John Veale as her guardian. (John Veale was Mary's uncle.) (1705-1721 Order Bk. p. 327a, abstracted by Dorman).  That she chose her guardian, she was at least 14, placing her birth as 1696-1703. <BR><BR>

<DD>29 Jan. 1717/8 a deed of gift by "Ellenor Smoot (now Trigg) to her son John Smoot" was proved. (1705-1721 Order Bk., p. 333a. abstracted by Dorman).  Same date Ellenor Trigg, relict of William Trigg, made oath that he died without a will. She was granted letters of administration with John Veale as her security. (p. 334) <BR><BR>

<DD>Eleanor third married John Austin.  They moved to St. Mary's Co., MD where he wrote his will 25 Mar. 1732/3.<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He named godson Austin Sanford Smoot.<BR>
Grandson-in-law William Harrison.<BR>
Daughter-in-law Elizabeth Trigg.<BR>
Wife Elliner.<BR>
If godson Austin Sanford Smoote dies without lawful issue his share to son-in-law John Smoote.<BR><BR>
Two sons-in-law John Smoote and William Harrison. </BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<DD>On 11 Feb. 1737 Elenor Astin (sic) signed as next of kin to the inventory of William Veale in St. Mary's Co., MD (her brother).<BR><BR>

<DD>Newman incorrectly stated that Eleanor died intestate.  She wrote her will 17 Mar. 1738/9 in St. Mary Co., MD, proved 14 April 1746.  Published abstracts of this will have small errors and omissions compared with the copy in MD Wills 24: 385 (FHL microfilm 12850).<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>She named son John Smoot to have 10 pounds.<BR>
John Smoot, son of her son John to have 5 pounds.<BR>
Child that Sarah Smoot now goes with an equal part with the rest of the grandchildren.
Thomas Rigg, William Neall (sic) Rigg, Subella Rigg, Winifred Rigg an equal part with the rest of the grandchildren.<BR>
Subella Rigg the feather bed and bedstead which belonged to "my Mother."<BR>

To Austin Sanford Smoot a horse, bridle and saddle.<BR>

To granddaughter Elizabeth Doxey a cow and calf, personal items in the possession of her father Thomas Doxey, and an equal part with the rest of the grandchildren.<BR>
To grandson John Doxey the feather bed that was formerly Jemima Trigg and an equal part with the rest of the grandchildren.<BR>
To Sarah Rigg, Winifred Harrison, Susanna Doxey, Sarah Smoot, Sarah Rice and "my cousin Susanna Green"  mourning gowns, hoods and gloves.<BR>
John Thomas 20 shillings to make her coffin.<BR><BR>
Son John Smoot executor.<BR>
Wit: John Stevens, William x Bryan, Sarah x Doxsey<BR><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Though not stated, the last bequest of mourning gowns, etc., other than Sarah Green, appear to me to all be daughters or daughter-in-law of Eleanor.<BR><BR>

<DD>Another document that aids in identification of the family is the will of William Veale written 4 Jan. 1737, proved 30 Jan. 1737 in St. Mary's Co., MD. (MD Cal. of Wills, 7: 237).  William was Eleanor's brother.  His land was to be divided equally between William, son of William Harrison (grandson and son-in-law of his sister Eleanor) and William, son of Morris Veale (his brother).  If either died their share was to go to William Veale Rigg, son of James Rigg. (grandson and son-in-law of his sister Eleanor)<BR><BR>

<DD>This gives:<BR>
William Smoot and wife Anne<BR>

<CENTER><B> [SMOOT-L] Smoot, William, the immigrant, descendants conjecture (Part 2)</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
 Hi,<BR><BR>

<DD>This is part two of my posting, the first dealing with William Smoot who died in 1707 in Westmoreland Co., VA in 1707.  This part will deal with new information presented in:
The Price, Blackemore, Hamblen, Skipworth and Allied Lines by Mayor Jay Berry Price (Knoxville, TN: Tenn. Valley Publishing, 1992)<BR><BR>

<DD>First, I will give an abbreviated list of descendants of William Smoot the immigrant as given by Harry Wright Newman.  The <B>numbers added are mine</B>, to aid later in this posting.<BR><BR>

1. William Smoot b. ca 1596/7<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. Thomas Smoot b. ca. 1634; d. ca. 1668 Charles Co., MD; m. Jane Batten<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. William Smoot ca. 1656; d. 1707 Westmoreland Co., VA (see                        part one of this posting for more details on him and descendants, and the listing of his children as below)
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. William Smoot born to first wife<BR>
                        7. Thomas Smoot born to first wife<BR>
                        8. Sarah Smoot born to second wife<BR>
                        9. Winifred Smoot born to second wife<BR>
                        10. Mary Smoot born to second wife<BR>
                        11. John Smoot born to second wife<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
                5. Thomas Smoot ca. 1660-1704/5; m. Elizabeth Barton<BR><BR>
                          <DD>12. Barton Smoot and other children<BR>
                  <DD>14. Edward Smoot</BLOCKQUOTE>
        3. William Smoot b. 16--, d. 1716 Richmond Co., VA
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Next, there are two entries in the Maryland land books for William Smoot claiming land in 1646.  One stated he transported 7 people, his wife Grace, and children Aels, Ann, Elizabeth, Richard and Thomas, and Elizabeth Wood, daughter of his wife Grace.  The other was also in 1646 for William Smoot with wife and two children.  Jourdon came to the same conclusion as I did, that this second one refers to a son of William, who was of age.  Price also believed that this second entry could refer to the son of William, Sr.  This would place the birth of the son William as ca. 1622, to have two children in 1646.<BR><BR>

<DD>If William, Jr. was born this early, and had two children in 1646, one has to question Newman's placement of William, Jr. as the one that went to Virginia, and died in 1716.  That would also mean he started a second family there in the 1690s, when he was 70 years old, continuing to have children until he was about 75.  Possible, but not very common.<BR><BR>

<DD>Next, consider this document presented by Price from Maryland Historical Society, Baltimore, Maryland Ms 1341 that Price stated appeared to be a court record.
"William Smoot the patentee of a Tract of Land lying in St. Mary's County called the Governor's Gift had three sons viz, William, Thomas & John.  William the first son had children by two wives viz William & Thomas by the first wife John & two sisters by the second wife.  Thomas the second son of the patentee had also issue Barton & others.  John the third son of the patentee likewise had issue Edward & others."<BR><BR>

<DD>Price goes on to quote from a memo attached to the record that was very difficult to read due to water smeared words.  Mentions land called Smoots Hollow surveyed by William Smoot, mentions survey for William Smoot 27 June 1667 and a survey 27 June 1647.  Price also listed finding a patent to Oliver Davis (Liber W.C.: 508) in 1677 called the "Governors Gift" in New Town Manor.  Mentioned Patent of William Smoot of June 1647, for "three hundred acres one hundred and fifty acres."  The "Governors Gift" was described as on the West side of Herring Creek, containing 150 acres.<BR><BR>

<DD>If this document is to be believed (and I don't know why it shouldn't be) it would cause some major shakeups in the Smoot line as presented by Newman, and copied by everyone since then.<BR><BR>

<DD>The only William I know who had two wives, with sons William and Thomas by the first, and John and two daughters by the second is 4. William Smoot listed above.  See my posting number 1 for the evidence that William and Thomas were by the first  wife, and John and the daughters were by the second.  There was no date given on this "court case" as presented by Price.  Could this have been about the time that 6. William Smoot of Westmoreland County in 1719 conveyed to 12. Barton Smoot of Charles Co., MD all claim to property in MD?  If so, then 10. Mary could have been deceased by then, and account for the listing of 2 sisters.  See posting 1 that she was probably deceased by 1733, and almost certainly by 1739 when her mother Eleanor wrote her will.<BR><BR>

<DD>The only Thomas Smoot with a son Barton that I know of in this time era are 5. Thomas and 12. Barton.  That 5. Thomas and 4. William are brothers is from a deed in 1683 where William sold land to his brother Thomas.   Newman made the assumption that this was the same William Smoot that was named in the will of William Battin as being the son of Battin's sister Jone Smoot.  He also assumed that this is the same William Smoot that received a patent in 1671 on "Smoots Chance" as the eldest son and heir of Thomas Smoot deceased.<BR><BR>

<DD>I know of no direct link stating that 5. Thomas is a son of 2. Thomas, only that he is a brother of 4. William.  Based on the court case presented by Price, and the other records mentioned above, it would appear there were two contemporary William Smoots, one the son of William, the other the son of Thomas.  My interpretation of reconciling all these records (using the same numbers as above is):<BR>

1. William Smoot<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. William Smoot b. ca. 1622
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. William Smoot d. 1707 Westmoreland Co., VA
 <BLOCKQUOTE>6. William Smoot born to first wife<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>15. William Smoot b. ca. 1656; d. 1716 Richmond Co., VA
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>I would appreciate comments/additions to this, regarding any pertinent records I may have overlooked, or other possible interpretations I may not have considered.<BR><BR>

<DD>If there is anyone on the list who has access to the MD Hist. Soc., a book I found on the manuscript collection of theirs described Ms.1341 as about 600 items of misc. land papers.  I think it would be very interesting if a separate reading was the same as Price's, or if another person could read the difficult parts better.  If it is possible to copy this document, I would gladly pay for the cost of the copy.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><B>[SMOOT-L] Re: William Smoot of VA; including Dorothy Durham information</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
Rick--<BR><BR>

<DD>I read your postings with great interest, since  we have been beating our
heads against William Smoot for quite some time.  Below my name is part of a
paper I've written about my early Durhams which attempts to figure out William
Smoot's connection to Dorothy (Mrs. Thomas) Durham.  You  having William as
#15, the son of Thomas Smoot, is an interesting idea; do you know the names of
Thomas and Jane Batton Smoot's daughters, by any chance?  (Are you paying
attention Steve and Glenn--THOMAS Smoot?!)<BR><BR>

Michelle Ule<BR>

Ukiah, CA<BR><BR>

(From the Durham paper written by me in 1998)

<DD>Somehow a Thomas Durham got to Virginia, whether as a child or on his own, we
don't know.  He planted tobacco in Richmond County and owned land.  At some
point before 1686, he married a woman named Dorothy, whom many genealogists
believed was the daughter of William Smoot.  Contrary evidence, however, shows
Dorothy Durham and her two sisters Alice Chinn Stretchley and Thomasin
Marshall Goodridge were more likely the daughters of one Mary Gilbert, widow.<BR><BR>
<DD>The primary historical connection between William Smoot Sr. and Dorothy
Durham is the granting of land in 1700.  On August 2, 1700, William Smoot Sr.:<BR><BR>
<DD>for love and affection for Dorothy Durham, wife of Thomas Durham,
and her children, deeded sixty-two acres of land entailing it upon their
eldest son Thomas Durham Jr., their second son, John Durham and their eldest
daughter, Mary Durham; he provides if all of these children the said land was
to descend to the fourth, fifth and sixth child of the said Dorothy Durham and
if all the aforementioned children of Dorothy Durham deceased, said land to
descend to Ann Fox, wife of William Fox, Gentleman, of Lancaster County.<BR><BR>

<DD>The property was given to Dorothy Durham and her three children "for love and
affection".  The land was "entailed" to the children: eldest son to second son
to daughter.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary, entail means "to
settle on a number of persons in succession so that it [an estate] cannot be
bequeathed at pleasure by any one possessor."<BR><BR>
<DD>The Encyclopedia Britannica explained that in entailed property, the
inheritance was "confined to the heirs of the body."  By entailing the gift
property to Dorothy Durham and her children, Smoot appeared to be ensuring the
property stayed specifically within her family.  Note the property was not
assigned to Thomas Durham Sr., at all.  This coupled with the notations about
love and affection, seemed to indicate Dorothy was at least a relative, and
many supposed she was his daughter.<BR><BR>
<DD>Ann Fox, to whom the land would revert if no Durhams survived, was Dorothy
Durham's niece, the married daughter of her sister Ann Chinn Stretchley.  Ann
Stretchley had other children who apparently were overlooked in this potential
gift. It is not clear if Thomasin Marshall Goodridge had any children at the
time of the deed.<BR><BR>
<DD>In the Smoot gift, Jane Smoot is listed as waiving her dower rights [Internet
comment from Steve Smoot].  The Oxford English Dictionary defines dower as "1.
the portion of a deceased husband's estate which the law allows to his widow
for life. 2.  The money or property which the wife brings to the husband."<BR><BR>
<DD>Customarily, when a woman waived her dower rights, she was agreeing not to
expect the property to become hers when her husband died.  But what if, in
this case, Jane was waiving rights to property she brought into the marriage
which her husband was then assigning to members of Jane's natal family?
Perhaps Dorothy Durham and her sisters were children of Jane's sister?  And
perhaps Jane's sister was Mary Gilbert?<BR><BR>
<DD>These questions are not answerable at present.  We do know, however, that
Dorothy Durham's son Thomas Durham Jr. married William Smoot's daughter Mary
about 1710.  Mary Smoot, however, would have been a seven year old child in
1700, so her future relationship with Dorothy Durham really isn't germane
here.<BR><BR>
<DD>In 1707, William Smoot deeded Thomas and Dorothy Durham another fifty acres
(Deed Book 4, page 109, 111).<BR><BR>
<DD>That same year, on April 26, Mary Gilbert deeded the Durhams 50 acres of land
"adjoining William Smoot's" gift, according to Shirley Corbari in The Guio-
Dodson Family.  The property was described in the deed book as being<BR> 
<DD>upon a branch of Farnham Creeke called and knowne by the name of the
Buory Swamp, containing by estimation fifty acres, now in the tanure and
occupation of William Wright.<BR> 
<DD>The deed was signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of William Smoot and
Mil. Walters.<BR><BR>
<DD>Miles Walters witnessed Thomas Durham's will eight years later, so perhaps he
was a neighbor.  Mary Gilbert obviously was acquainted with William Smoot.<BR><BR>
<DD>William Smoot Sr. died in 1716; his will named his wife Jane, son-in-law
Thomas Durham and three grandchildren: Margaret, Joseph and Sarah Durham (the
only three Durham children born at the time of Smoot's death).  The fact his
will made no mention of the sisters Dorothy, Alice and Thomasin (Dorothy and
Thomasin were still alive) would indicate they probably were not his
daughters.  Jane Smoot died in North Farnham Parish on October 4, 1726.<BR><BR>
<DD>Alice was born about 1665 and married John Chin (16??-1692)[Corbari] by whom
she had three, possibly four children as named in her 1701 will: Ann
Fox(1682-1729), Catherine Heal, Rawleigh and possibly Jno. Chin.  Her second
husband was John Stretchley, Gentleman (ca 1649-1698).<BR><BR> 
<DD>Alice's August 29, 1701 will is confusing in regard to relationships and
lists them as follows:<BR><BR>
<DD>daughters Ann Fox and Catherine Heal; sister Dorothy Durham; cousin
Mary Dodson; son-in-law Capt. William Fox; Ann Fox's father, Jno. Chin; Ann
Fox's father-in-law Jno. Stretchly; son Rawleigh Chin; sister Tomazin
Marshall". [Lancaster Co. VA Inventories and Wills 1690-1709, vol 8, p. 105]<BR><BR>
<DD>Dodson family historian Glenn Gohr pointed out seventeenth century people
sometimes defined relationships differently than we do in the present.  In
this case, Mary Dodson was Alice's niece, not her cousin.  This is interesting
in light of the reference to "Ann Fox's father, Jno. Chin", a man who is
believed to have died several years before and then been succeeded by John
Stretchly.  Stretchly is described as Ann's father-in-law in the will, but he
actually was her step-father.  Alice left something to Jno. Chin, so perhaps
he was her son, not her ex-husband.<BR><BR>
<DD>Thomasin Marshall Goodridge is believed to have been born about 1667.  She is
thought to have married Abraham Marshall, who owned land in Richmond County
which eventually came into the possession of the Durhams.  (And they sold it
in 1723 to Thomas Dodson Sr.).  It is not clear when Marshall died, but at
some point after 1701 Thomasin married William Goodridge.<BR><BR>
<DD>William Goodridge signed his will on May 12, 1713 and it contained the
following provisions:<BR><BR>
<DD>named Thomasin wife of William; to son William all land in Lanc.
Co., which I bought of Richard Alderson and John (Buxton); other chil. Moses
and Elizabeth; desires Mr. Rawleigh Chinn to have the care of the three chil.
until age 21; ex: fr. Rawleigh Chinn; wits: none given, but prov. By the oaths
of Dorothy and Thomas Durham (Sr.). [Wills of Richmond County, VA 1699-1800]
<BR><BR>
<DD>Rawleigh Chinn was Alice Chinn Stretchley's son and thus a cousin to
Goodridge's children (Interestingly, the Rawleigh name appeared for
generations afterwards in the Dodson family).  The children, thus, probably
were Thomasin's children as well.  The Durhams provided an oath certifying the
will; they were Goodridge's sister-in-law and brother-in-law.  The familial
relationship is further explained in a reference to "Aunt Dorothea" in
Rawleigh's sister Ann Chinn Fox Chichester's 1725 will.  (The IGI lists
Dorothy Durham's death as 1716, but the 1725 reference suggests she must have
lived at least that long).<BR><BR>
<DD>This lengthy discussion of Dorothy Durham's sisters is to explain in part why
she is not believed to be William Smoot's daughter.  Neither Dorothy nor her
still-living sister Thomasin were mentioned in Smoot's 1715 will, though
Dorothy's Durham grandchildren (the children of Smoot's daughter Mary Smoot
Durham) were included.<BR><BR>
<DD>Mary Gilbert, described as a widow in an indenture she signed to Thomas and
Dorothy Durham, is believed to be Dorothy Durham's mother instead.  The
aforementioned indenture, signed April 26, 1707, gave fifty acres of land to
Thomas and Dorothy Durham and their heirs.<BR><BR>
<DD>Mary Gilbert probably was married to James Gilbert, though we do not know if
he was the father of her daughters.  Virginia Colonial Abstracts, Richmond
County, Records 1704-1724, compiled by Beverly Fleet, lists a series of
depositions made about James Gilbert.  Among those testifying were Dorothy
Durham (age 41 years in 1704) and William Smoot.<BR><BR>
<DD>The depositions appear to be about James Gilbert's will which someone was
contesting.  Gilbert is portrayed as an irreligious, hunting-loving man at
odds with his wife and some of his neighbors.  He had told witness Ann Kelly
"he had not the sense to make a will" and she saw James Gilbert "count 15 head
of Cattle for fourty".  He apparently died of burns between New Year's Day and
November of 1704.<BR><BR>
<DD>According to her deposition, Ann Kelly was a servant to Thomas "Dierham"
(Durham) and Mary Gilbert was staying with the Durham family on New Year's Day
1704.  Durham sent Kelly to fetch Gilbert to the Durham home and along the way
he stopped and complained that John Mills (a neighbor) was the cause for the
problems James was having with his wife.  According to the depositions, Mills
had written a false will for Gilbert and after leaving 20 shillings for Mrs.
Gilbert, assumed the rest of the estate for himself.  The Gilberts had a
servant of their own, Thomas V. Longdale, who was set free by the alleged will
at Gilbert's death.  The records do not record how the suit was finally
settled.<BR><BR>
<DD>Curiously, neither Mary nor James Gilbert were mentioned in Alice Chinn
Stretchley's 1701 will, though they both were alive at the time.<BR><BR>
<DD>We don't know when Mary Gilbert died, but Thomas Durham Sr. signed his will
on August 4, 1711.  He made two references to land conveyed by Mary Gilbert:<BR><BR>
<DD>Item.  I give and Bequeath unto my Dear and Loving wife Dorothy
Durham the use of my Plantations, together with all my Lands and Tenements
with all and Every of their Appurtenances--Profits and Commoditys ----
Belonging or appertaining for and During the ----of her natural Life and after
her Decease if my Son Thomas Durham and Mary his wife do by some sufficient
instrument in writing under their hands and seals and affording to due forme
of Law Release and Acquitt all and singular their Right ,title and Interest in
and unto Fifty acres of Land being the same Tract & Plantations which we had
conveyed us by Mary Gilbert unto my son John Durham and his heirs or pay him
the said: John Durham Eight Thousand Pounds of Tobacco in Lieu of His said
Land and also pay unto my Daughter Mary Dodson Fifteen hundred pounds of
Tobacco that then and upon this consideration-----aforesaid: I do give and
bequeath unto my said son Thomas Durham and his heirs Lawfully Begotten and
for want of such issue unto my son John Durham and his heirs Lawfully Begotten
and for want of such issue unto my GrandSon Thomas Dodson and his heirs. But
if my said son Thomas Durham doth refuse and will not release the said fifty
acres of Land nor pay the Tobacco aforesaid: I do will and Bequeath the said
Plantation whereon I now dwell with all my Lands unto my son John Durham and
his heirs---<BR><BR>

<DD>Item.  I give and Bequeath unto my Son John Durham Fifty acres of Land more or
less being the Plantation with all the Tract and Parcell of Land that was
Conveyed us by Mary Gilbert, to have and to hold the said Tract and Parcell of
Land with the appurtainances unto my said son John Durham and his heirs
Lawfully begotten and for want of such issue unto my GrandSon Thomas Dodson
and his heirs-<BR><BR>

<DD>The will appears to be talking about the same fifty acres of land indentured
to the Durhams by Mary Gilbert in 1707.  It apparently was a nice plantation
if Thomas and Dorothy Durham had moved into the house by the time of Thomas'
death!  Thomas Durham also seemed determined to ensure the property stayed
within the family, assigning the plantation to second son John if oldest son
Thomas Durham Jr. did not follow the instructions laid out by the dying man.<BR><BR>
<DD> Thomas Durham Sr.'s assigning the property to oldest grandson Thomas Dodson
Jr., also indicated the older man was trying to keep the property in the
family.  This would seem to imply Mary Gilbert probably was a family member.<BR><BR>
<DD>All that being said,  Mary Gilbert probably was Dorothy, Alice and Thomasin's
mother.  Whether their father's name was Gilbert, or perhaps a Thomas with
another surname (to explain Thomasin's unusual name) , is simply unknown.

<CENTER><B>[SMOOT-L] Re: Smoot, William</B></CENTER><BR><BR>

Hi Michelle,<BR><BR>

<DD>No, I don't know of any daughters of Thomas Smoot and Jane Batten.  Steve Smoot is the person who pointed me in the direction of the book by Price, when I asked him the source on his webpage of my William Smoot's (d. 1707) wife Eleanor being a Veale.<BR><BR>

<DD>Since reading that, I have spent months gathering information on William's (d. 1707) descendants and the related Veale family, in trying to determine how all the people mentioned in Eleanor's will related.  Once I believed I had that straight, I have gone round and round in my own mind trying to reconcile the document listing a William with the sons William, Thomas and John. 

<DD>I briefly looked at your William, died 1716 Richmond Co., VA, and wondered if be could be the father, since in the 1690s there was listed a William Smoot, Jr. in records with him.  He didn't seem to fit, though.  

<DD>I kept coming back to the statement that William was the father of Thomas who was the father of Barton "and others."  Yesterday everything clicked into place and I came up with the family as I listed it, and what to do with the "other William" son of Thomas Smoot and Jane Batten.  As I said, if the family as I have listed it is correct, it will have a lot of far reaching effects.  

<DD>That is why I posted what I did, so it could be seen how this would effect other relationships, and if it still all makes since.  As one example, Newman said that Thomas Smoot and Jane Batten had a son James.  I haven't even attempted to look at records regarding James and if this is still where he would fit in.

<DD>I'll follow this posting with some information regarding the Barton family as related to the Smoot family.  In addition to my connection through William Smoot (d. 1707), I also descend from the immigrant William Smoot's daughter Anne who married first William Hungerford, and second William Barton.  My grandparents were ninth cousins once removed to each other.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><B>[SMOOT-L] SMOOT-- book reprint and Dorothy Durham</B></CENTER><BR><BR>

Hi, <BR><BR>

<DD>I know at least one reprint of Newman's book has been done, but I don't know the date or who did it.  The  reprint I saw
was one of those spiral bound types.  It was privately owned by James Jeffreys (sp?), who is one of the librarians in the
Western History and Genealogical Department of the Denver Public Library.  A call or letter to him there could probably
learn who/where it was republished, and from there find if copies are still available.<BR><BR>
<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100"><BR>

<DD>For the Dorothy married to Thomas Durham problem I haven't really studied it much.  Just from a quick reading of the
material and messages, I can see it would be a several hour venture to begin to get a feeling for all the names. <BR><BR>

<DD>I do have a couple comments and questions.  Most transactions I have seen of the type involving William Smoot and Dorothy
and her children, are either father to daughter and grandchildren, or brother to sister, and nieces and nephews. <BR><BR>

<DD>If you accept Newman's identity of William, then if Dorothy was his sister, that would make her a daughter of William and
Grace as Glenn suggested on his site.  The questions I have on this are: could Grace have had a daughter born as late as
about 1660, the age given for her?  The problem is we don't really know when William and Grace married, how old she may
have been, and if she could have had a child born as late as 1660.  Do we know who/when her daughter Elizabeth Wood
married, giving us an idea of Elizabeth's age, and thus an idea of Grace's age?  If Dorothy was a daughter of William and
Grace, one thing I note is the lack of use of the name Dorothy among  the children of what would be her brothers and
sisters. <BR><BR>

<DD>If you go with the makeup as I suggested yesterday, and that William of Richmond Co., VA is the son of Thomas Smoot and
Jane Batten.  Then if Dorothy was a sister to William, she would be a daughter of Thomas Smoot and Jane Batten.  In this
case we definitely know that they could have had a daughter born in 1660.

<CENTER><B>[SMOOT-L] Re: William Smoot of VA; including Dorothy Durham 
information</B></CENTER><BR><BR>


Michelle,<BR><BR>

<DD>Thanks so much for calling my attention to the Dorothy (SMOOT?) Durham
controversy again.  It appears we all need to study & try to make sure we
have accurate birth dates for the early Smoots (even approximate dates) in
case Harry Wright Newman or others have placed Smoots in the wrong family
grouping.<BR><BR>

<DD>Thanks Rick Saunders for all your input on the early Smoots.  Maybe this
will help us to get a few more items hammered out and arrive at the truth
on the early Smoots.  Thanks also to Steve Smoot for his assistance now and
in the past.<BR><BR>

<DD>Michelle, thanks for posting your Durham/Smoot article that you wrote last
year.  It gave some convincing arguments that one Williams Smoot, Sr. was
the father of Dorothy (Smoot?) Durham and her two sisters, Alice Chinn
Stretchley and Thomasin Marshall Goodridge.  I still feel because of
Dorothy's age, that her father would need to be William Smoot (Smute) the
immigrant who had a wife Grace (possibly his 2nd wife & not the mother of
Dorothy, Alice & Thomasin).<BR><BR>

<DD>Now, Michelle, you also give convincing arguments that these 3 sisters
could be daughters of a Mary Gilbert also (and I believe I was the one who
steered you in this direction).  After rereading all this one more time, I
am coming up with new conclusions--unless you or others can find some holes
in my arguments.<BR><BR>

<DD>On my web page at:<BR><BR>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prairie/5821/smoot.html">

http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prairie/5821/smoot.html</A><BR><BR>
I list Dorothy (Smoot?) Durham as a daughter of William Smoot, Sr. & wife
Grace as a possible connection.  I also direct researchers to my Dodson
Puzzle 1 & Dodson Puzzle 2 pages:<BR><BR>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prairie/5821/dodsonpuzzle.html">

http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prairie/5821/dodsonpuzzle2.html</A>
<BR><BR>

where I've included information on this Durham/Smoot/Dodson puzzle which
has baffled me and others for years.  There are copies of actual wills &
deeds.  Also a letter I wrote years ago about this problem.  You may wish
to reread what Michelle posted to the Smoot List along with what is on my
Smoot & Dodson & Durham web pages.<BR><BR>

<DD>Anyway, my latest conclusions are this:<BR><BR>

Why couldn't Mary Gilbert be the mother of Thomas Durham, instead of
Dorothy??!!!!<BR><BR>

<DD>In the past researchers have listed Thomas Durham's parents as Henry Durham
of Bermuda who married on 14 Feb. 1660 in Bermuda to Judith Hunt.  However,
currently we DO NOT KNOW the parents of Thomas Durham.<BR><BR>

<DD>He was reported to have been born ca. 1661 (because of the above marriage
date of Henry & Judith) in Bermuda, married ca. 1680 in Richmond Co., VA to
Dorothy (Smoot? or Gilbert?) & died 1714 Richmond Co., VA.<BR><BR>

<DD>We do not know where Thomas Durham was born or his year of birth.  Possibly
he was born earlier that 1660.  The only date of birth I have for Dorothy
currently is ca. 1660 (based on Thomas Durham's supposed birth date).  Does
anyone else have a better year of birth for Dorothy?  or for her known
sisters Alice & Thomasin?<BR><BR>

<DD>GENE B ROOKS<VWTK60A@prodigy.com > posted several messages to the 
Dodson List on Rootsweb beginning on March 5, 1998 which stated that Thomas 
Durham who married Dorothy was definitely NOT the son of Henry Durham and 
Judith Hunt.  He wrote to the Bermuda archives. They sent him a copy of a case in the 
Court of Assize in 1734 involving an Action of Trespass, which involved one Richard 
Durham of Sandys as heir to estate of Thomas DURHAM, of the same parish.  Thomas 
was the son of Henry DURHAM who died in 1692. The cover letter also said "This 
seems to suggest that Thomas was living in Bermuda and not America, though I can 
trace no direct proof.  I can not locate a copy of Henry Durham's will, which I believe 
would indicate where. his son was located." <BR><BR>

Gene Rooks included a brief abstract of the court case.<BR><BR>

<DD>Since we do not know the parents of Thomas Durham, why couldn't his mother
be the Mary Gilbert mentioned in the deeds.  If you reread the deeds, it
sounds as if Thomas Durham is the one receiving and passing along the
property to his family, instead of it coming in right of his wife, Dorothy.<BR><BR>

If Mary Gilbert is the mother of Thomas Durham (I assume she was married
previously to a man named DURHAM), then that leaves it open for Dorothy and
her sisters to be daughters of a William Smoot, Sr.  (Was there more than
one William Smoot of the right age to be the father of Dorothy, Alice &
Thomasin? or is William the immigrant the only one old enough to be their
parents???  Did William the immigrant ever end up in VA or is he confined
only to MD?)<BR><BR>

What do you think, Michelle?<BR><BR>

Hi,<BR><BR>
<DD>Glenn posted earlier a statement by way of Vicki Annico from the Dodson list 
that "Marriages of Richmond Co. 1668-1853" by Geo H. S. King stated that Thomas 
Durham married Dorothy Morris, daughter of Captain Thomas Morris.<BR><BR>

<DD>"Marriage of Richmond County, Virginia 1668-1853" compiled by George H. S. 
King (Easley, SC: Southern Historical Press, Inc, 1964) p. 61 states "Thomas Durham 
married 168? Dorothy___________ (born circa 1663), probably a relative of William 
Smoot, Sr . . . 
"<BR><BR>

<DD>p. 81 states Jeremiah Greenham and Dorothy Durham (widow), license February 
1714/15 (Dorothey Durham was the widow of Thomas Durham . . . "<BR><BR>

<DD>p. 250 asks "Who were the parents of these three sisters?" and has a diagram of 
Dorothy Alice, and Thomasin and their families.<BR><BR>

<DD>There are Morris' in the index, but not Thomas Morris.  Wherever Vicki Annico 
got the information, it was not from that book, unless it is on a page missed by the 
index.

<CENTER><B>[ SMOOT-L] The Unending Puzzle of Wm Smoot and the Mysterious Dorothy</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
<DD>This is from VIRGINIA COLONIAL ABSTRACTS, edited by Dorothy Fleet, Richmond
County Records, 1704-1724 (probably volume I of three), page 291:<BR><BR>

<DD>(p.37) "Power of Atty.  11 June 1705.  John Ingo of Farnam par. Rd. Co. to 'my
trusty and well beloved friend and brother James Ingo of the abovesaid County'
to transact business.   On lines 10 and 11 the following appears 'or any other
Business that is belonging to me the said John Ingo Green and by these
presents x'.  the name 'Green' introduced here may possibly be an error in the
original.  Signed John Ingo.  Wit: WM SMOOT, DORRATHY X DURRAN
<BR><BR>
<DD>There is a lengthy series of depositions in Richmond County, Miscellaneous
Records, Book 1 p. 285 -287 (this was volume I) of Fleet's abstracts. [Thank
you to Gene Rook who called them to my attention quite some time ago]. The
depositions concern themselves with one JAMES GILBERT, whom we believe
probably was the husband of MARY GILBERT.  The Gilberts lived either with the
Durhams or in close proximity to the Durhams, as well as the Ingos
and--probably--William Smoot (whose wife is never mentioned, by the way).
<BR><BR>
<DD>[Those who were with us last week, will remember some of us believe Mary
Gilbert may have been the mother of the feminine trio Dorothy, Thomazine and
Alice, albeit with a different father (Captain John Morris?--but Gene found on
the Internet his wife's name was Sarah . . . ) Glenn Gohr, on the other hand,
is now positing Mary Gilbert could have been Thomas Durham's mother.  You can
see why I have so many convoluted diagrams scrawled all over my house!]
<BR><BR>
<DD>Anyway, the depositions are interesting because, once again, they include
depositions by Dorothy Durham and William Smoot, and references to the two
in"company" together with others.  John Ingo also appears in these
depositions.  I'm going to type them all out after my name--they are lengthy
with challenging spelling--and perhaps someone here can reach some conclusions
I have not thought of!

<DD>We never heard the outcome of this series of depositions, but obviously
someone (Mrs. Gilbert?) was contesting the will.<BR><BR>

<DD>William Smoot Sr. gave the land "for love and affection for Dorothy Durham ,
wife of Thomas Durham and her children" on August 2, 1700.<BR><BR>

<DD>He deeded Thomas and Dorothy Durham another 50 acres in 1707. <BR><BR>

<DD>That same year Mary Gilbert deeded the Durhams 50 acres of land "adjoining
William Smoot's" gift--according to Shirley Corbari in The Guio-Dodson Family.
William Smoot witnessed that deed, along with Miles Walters.  Thomas Durham's
1711 will made reference, twice, to that 50 acre parcel, trying to ensure the
property stayed within the family (by inheritance, it went to eldest son
Thomas Durham, thence to second son John Durham and if all else failed, to
eldest grandson Thomas Dodson, son of daughter Mary).  Reading it through
again, I can see why Glenn might think Mary Gilbert could be Thomas Durham's
mother.  In that case, naming his only daughter Mary, makes sense.<BR><BR>

<DD>But who was William Smoot?  An overly kind neighbor?<BR><BR>

Help!

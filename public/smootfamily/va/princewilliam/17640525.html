<A NAME="lease">&#0134; <B>Deeds of Lease and Release</B>  <BR><BR>

Deeds of lease and release are often found in Virginia, usually in the Northern Neck and in the older counties.  The lease, for a nominal sum, is followed by the release noting the actual sale price.  The lease may predate the release by a day, a week, or even a year.  The two documents together make up a legal deed and should not be confused with a simple lease to rent land.  This is based on the English practice requiring possession of the land before an actual transfer of title could take effect.  <BR><BR>

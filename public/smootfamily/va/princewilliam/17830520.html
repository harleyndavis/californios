Thomas Smoot&#0146;s Will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | <BR><BR>

<DIV ALIGN="justify"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In the name of God, Amen I Thomas Smoot of the County of Prince William 
in the Commonwealth of Virginia being sick and weak in body tho&#0146; 
of sound sense and memory (God be praised) do make and ordain this my 
last will and testament as followeth.  First and most principally I 
give and bequeath my soul to God (who gave it first to me) in hopes of 
a pardon of all my sins and his gracious acceptance, thru the only merit 
of my Savior Jesus Christ.  My body I commend to the earth to be decently 
buried at the discretion of my executor hereafter named in expectation 
of a happy resurrection and reunion with my soul at the Last Day, and 
what worldly goods God has been pleased to bestow on me, I give and 
bequeath after my just debts and funeral expenses are paid in the 
following manner. <BR>
Item.&nbsp;  I give and bequeath to my son Notly Smoot a young roan mare, 
saddle and bridle now in his possession. <BR>
Item.&nbsp;  I give and bequeath to my son William Mattox Smoot a bay horse, saddle 
and bridle now in his possession. <BR>
Item.&nbsp;  I give and bequeath to my son Thos S<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT> Henley 
Smoot<A HREF="#bristoe">&#0134;</A>  a black horse colt, saddle and bridle now in his possession, and if 
he should die before 
he is fit for service, then I give him another horse of equal value with Notley&#0146;s and Wm 
Mattox&#0146;s. <VR>
Item.&nbsp;  I give and bequeath to my daughter Mary Ballenger five shillings cash, she having already 
received a sufficient proportion of my estate. <BR>
Item.&nbsp;  I give and bequeath to my loving wife Elizabeth all my Negroes and stocks of all kinds and 
all the residue and remainder of my estate of what nature soever during her widowhood, and at her 
marriage or death I give and bequeath the said Negroes, stocks and all other my said estate to be 
equally divided between my sons Henry Smoot, George Mattox Smoot, James Mattox Smoot and the child 
that my said wife is now pregnant with, and to their heirs forever, but in case any of the said 
Henry, George Mattox, James Mattox or unborn child shall die before they be possessed of the 
estate hereby intended, that the same be equally divided between the survivors of my said four 
children last mentioned.  But if it shall so happen at the marriage or death of my said wife 
that my Negroes should have increased so that their should be one for each of all my before 
mentioned children except Mary Ballenger, then in that case my will and desire is that my said 
sons Notly, W<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>m</U></SUP></FONT> Mattox and Thos 
S<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT>  Henly 
have each of them out of the increase of the said 
Negroes one young Negro and no more, Notly to have first choice, Wm Mattox next and 
Thos S<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT> Henly last.  And lastly I hereby nominate 
and appoint my loving wife Executrix of this my last will and testament during her widowhood 
reposing the care and tuition of my children to her, but in case my said wife shall marry, 
I appoint my sons Notly and W<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>m</U></SUP></FONT>  Mattox 
Executors in her stead, and my will is that my said 
executrix shall not give security and may remove to any place or state she shall choose, 
and that my estate be not appraised, and that my right and possession of Bristoe&#0146;s 
Land<A HREF="#bristoe">&#0135;</A> 
be sold and the money laid out for the benefit of my estate.  In witness whereof I hereunto set 
my hand and seal this 20<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>th</U></SUP></FONT> of May 1783.  <BR>

It is generally accepted that the &#0147;S<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT>&#0148; 
abbreviation (with the superscript <FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>t</U></SUP></FONT> ) stands for Saint
although Stewart, Stuart, and perhaps other names are possible. 
We have not been able to find a Saint Henly (Henley) in lists of saints.

&#0135;&nbsp; <B>Bristoe&#0146;s Land</B> <BR><BR>

Bristoe&#0146;s Land was a large tract of land in Prince William County formerly owned by 
Robert Bristoe, who leased it out to tenants in exchange for rental payments of tobacco.  
In 1779, Bristoe was adjudged to be an enemy alien, and his land was confiscated by the 
State of Virginia, which thereafter administered the land and collected the tobacco 
lease payments.  <BR><BR>

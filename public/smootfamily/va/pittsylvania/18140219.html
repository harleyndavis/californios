<FONT SIZE="+1">Notes: </FONT><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this 1814 Pittsylvania County deed (Christopher 
Robertson to George W. Smoot ), we see as a 
witness, one John B. Smoot. It is possible but not proven that George W. Smoot and John B. Smoot 
were brothers. They were not successful at running the tannery, which was sold at auction to pay
debts. George W. Smoot moved to Wilkes County, North Carolina in 1818.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We see the marriage record John B. Smoot to 
Delilah Shumate in Henry County Virginia, marriage 
bond dated 30 December 1816. I believe Delilah Shumate is the sister of George W. Smoot&#0146;s 
wife, Frances &#0147;Aggie&#0148; Shumate, Henry County Marriage bond dated 18 November 1813 
with witness/security Toliver Shumate. Married 23 November 1813.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George W. Smoot paid personal property 
taxes in Pittsylvania County, VA from
1814 through 1818.  John B. Smoot paid personal property taxes there in
1816.  Another Smoot who was living in Pittsylvania County at that time was
Cary Shumate, widow of John Shumate and daughter of Leonard Smoot of
Fauquier County, VA.  Fauquier marriage bond dated 6 Feb 1808, permission of
her father Leonard Smoot, security/witness James Norman.  (Cary is short for
Keronhappuck!). <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the realm conjecture, I offer that the John B. Smoot on the above deed 
may be the same John B. Smoot as found on 
this <A HREF="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/tn/lincoln/18300430.html">1828 deed</A> Lincoln 
County Tennessee. That tract of land included a tannery. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This Indenture made this ninth day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety nine between 
Peter Shinhold of the County of Hampshire and State of Virginia of the one part and John Smoot of the county and state 
aforesaid of the other part.  Witnesseth that the said Peter Shinhold in order to secure payment of the following debt, to wit, 
the sum of seventeen pounds due to George Cooper and payable the fifteenth day of next March for which the said John 
Smoot is jointly bound in a bond with the said Shinhold, in consideration whereof and for the further sum of one dollar in 
hand paid to me by the said John Smoot, I have bargained and sold and by these presents do bargain and sell and deliver 
to the said John Smoot as his proper right and property, one three year old yellow bay horse, one wagon and two cows, 
To have and to hold the above described property, yet nevertheless, if the said Peter Shinhold, his heirs, executors or 
administrators shall well and truly pay to the said George Cooper the above mentioned sum of seventeen pounds, and to the 
said John Smoot the same, of one dollar, on or before the fifteenth of next March, then the said property, or which shall be alive 
of them, shall be returned by the said Smoot to the said Shinhold as if no such sale had been made, but if the said Shinhold should 
fail to pay the above debts with all costs and interest and charges that may accrue thereon, then the said John Smoot may proceed 
to sell the same to pay the debts, having first advertised the same in the Winchester newspaper, and out of money arising from said 
sale to pay the debts, costs, interest and charges and the residue  if any to pay to the said Shinhold or his agent if any he have, 
if not to pay it to anyone lawfully claiming the same.  In witness whereof, I Peter Shinhold have hereunto set my hand and affixed my 
seal this 27<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>th</SUP></FONT> day of June 1799.  <BR>

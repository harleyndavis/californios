the term of her natural life Negro boy Edmund and Negro girl Artha.  I further give to 
my said wife for the term of her natural life two beds and bedding, to be chosen by her 
out of those of which I may die possessed, one desk to be chosen of those of which I may 
die possessed, and also the cupboard which is in the house, also the clock and the chairs 
which may be in the house at my decease.  The rest and residue of my personal estate not 
herein specifically given to my wife I wish to be sold after my death and after paying my 
just debts, and the sum in cash above given to my wife, I wish equally divided between my 
two sons Samuel and Thomas.  And I further will that after the death of my said wife that 
the property herein given to her for her natural life is to be sold and the proceeds equally 
divided between my said sons if living, and if dead, or if either be them be dead, between 
their heirs, or if but one be living at the death of said wife, then between the survivor 
and the heirs of the other in two equal parts.</I>&#0148;</FONT> And whereas the parties of the first part 
have sold the one undivided moiety of half part of the real, personal and mixed estate 
willed to his said wife Jane by said Josiah Smoot dec&#0146;d for the term of her natural life

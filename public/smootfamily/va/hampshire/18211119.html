&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commonwealth of Virginia to the Sheriff of Hampshire County, Greeting.  You are hereby 
commanded to summons twelve fit persons being freeholders to meet upon the land proposed for 
a road on the petition of sundry inhabitants of Hampshire County, leading from the land of 
John Torrance through the lands of Mary Smoot down right to near the tract of the old lane 
that formerly passed by the said Mary Smoot&#0146;s house, thence nearest and best way to the new 
road open on the petition of John Patterson and others and that you then and there charge 
them upon oath to inquire into the damage which Mary Smoot through whose land the said road 
will pass will sustain in conveyance thereof.  A report duly drawn up and executed under your 
seal and the seal of the said jurors you are to return to the next court to be holden for 
Hampshire County in November next together with the writ.  Witness John B. White, clerk of 
our said court at the courthouse aforesaid the 19<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>th</SUP></FONT> day 
of October 1821 and in the 46<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>th</SUP></FONT> year of the Commonwealth.  <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executed James Vance D.S. FOR Edward McCarty  <BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inquisition indented and taken on the land of Mary Smoot where the road prayed for leading 
from the lands of the said Mary Smoot through the lands of the track of the old lane that 
formerly passed by the said Mary Smoot&#0146;s house, thence the nearest and best way to the new 
road opened on the petition of John Patterson and others.  In obedience to a Writ of Ad Quod 
Damnum to the Sheriff for said county, have summoned and impaneled twelve good and lawful 
freeholders of my bailiwick no way related to either of the parties, which jury is as follows, 
to wit: James Powell, William Myers, William Hamilton, George Fletcher, Isaac Cunningham, 
Alexander Patterson, Jacob Shinholt, Asa Everett, Christopher Kurtz, Eli Delaplaine, David 
Creaps, and Leonard Menser, who being met this 10<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>th</SUP></FONT> day 
of November 1821 upon the land of the aforesaid Mary Smoot in the said county through 
which the said road is to be conducted to intersect the road opened on the petition 
of John Patterson and others as mentioned in the said writ will necessarily pass, 
and being duly sworn were charged by me impartially to the best of their skill and 
judgment to view the land of the aforesaid Mary Smoot in case the road aforesaid 
should be established taking into estimation as [?] the use of such land so laid upon 
for such road as the addition of every which will thereby be rendered necessary, and the jurors 
aforesaid upon their oaths do say that the damages will be to the aforesaid Mary Smoot to the 
amount of $10 current money of the United States.  In witness whereof the said Sheriff as also 
the jurors aforesaid have hereunto set our hands and seals the day and year and place herein 
before mentioned. <BR><DIV ALIGN="right">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hampshire County Court: At a court held for the said county, be it remembered that on the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ad quod damnum</B>. The name of a writ formerly issuing from the English chancery, 
commanding the sheriff to make inquiry &#0147;to what damage&#0148; a specified act, 
if done, will tend. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a writ which ought to be sued before the king grants certain 
liberties, as a fair, 
market or such like, which may be prejudicial to others, and thereby it should be inquired 
whether it will be a prejudice to grant them, and to whom it will be prejudicial, and what 
prejudice will come thereby. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also another writ of ad quod damnum, 
if any one will turn a common highway and lay 
out another way as beneficial. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A &#0147;writ of ad quod damnum&#0148; is of ancient origin, 
and could be issued as a writ of right when 
landowner was dissatisfied with assessment of damages by condemnation commission. </FONT> <BR>

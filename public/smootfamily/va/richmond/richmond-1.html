Thomas DURHAM&#0146;s 1711 will made reference, twice, to that 50 acre parcel, trying to ensure the 
property stayed within the family (by inheritance, it went to eldest son Thomas DURHAM, thence 
to second son John DURHAM and if all else failed, to eldest grandson Thomas Dodson, son of 
daughter Mary). Reading it through again, I can see why Glenn might think Mary Gilbert could be 
Thomas DURHAM&#0146;s mother. In that case, naming his only daughter Mary, makes sense.

Thomas DURHAM&#0146;s 1711 will made reference, twice, to that 50 acre parcel, trying to ensure the property stayed 
within the family (by inheritance, it went to eldest son Thomas DURHAM, thence to second son John DURHAM and 
if all else failed, to eldest grandson Thomas Dodson, son of daughter Mary). Reading it through again, I can 
see why Glenn might think Mary Gilbert could be Thomas DURHAM&#0146;s mother. In that case, naming his only daughter 
Mary, makes sense.
<BR><BR>
((CH Notes: Mary, d/o Thomas Sr. and Dorothy, was born 5 Jun 1686, married before ?, Thomas DODSON, s/o Charles 
and Ann, b 15 May 1681. Thomas, Jr., s/o Thomas Sr. and Dorothy, was born 27 Jun 1690, married before 1708,

died in 1701 in Lancaster Co, VA (WB8:105-6). Her children named in the will were Ann FOX, wife of Capt. William 
FOX, Catherine HEAL and Rawleigh CHINN. The other sister was Thomazin SMOOT who married a MARSHALL.&#0148; DNFP does not

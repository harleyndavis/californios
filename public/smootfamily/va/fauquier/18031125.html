In the name of God Amen, I Christopher Hitch being weak and low and having heretofore 
made and executed my last will and testament do add the following codicil which it is my 
will and desire may be incorporated with and taken as a part of my said will.  That is to 
say, it is my will and desire that my three daughters Airy Hitch, Nelly Hitch and Darkey 
Hitch live in the house I now occupy as long as they live unmarried and enjoy in common 
with my three sons Levin Hitch, Elias Hitch and Loyd Hitch the profits of the two leases 
before willed to my said three sons during their residences as aforesaid or until they or 
either of them marry, in which case, the proportion of the one marrying is to cease from 
the time of her marriage.  It is also to be understood that this provision is made for my 
said daughters only while they remain single but to cease at the time of their several 
marriages.  It is further my will and desire that my mother may live with my said three 
daughters and be maintained out of my estate as long as she lives with them, but it is not 
intended she shall be maintained out of my estate unless she lives with my said daughters.  
And lastly it is my will that my two sons Elias Hitch and Loyd Hitch have a bed and 
furniture each in addition to the property before give them.  In witness whereof I have 
hereunto set my hand and seal the 
14<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>th</SUP></FONT> day of May 1805 hereby in all 
things confirming my said last will with the addition of this codicil. <BR>

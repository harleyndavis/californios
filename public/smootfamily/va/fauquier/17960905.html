I John Smoot of the County of Fauquier being very sick and weak in body 
but of perfect mind and memory, thanks be given to kind providence.  
Calling unto mind the mortality of my body and knowing that it is 
appointed for all men to die, do make and ordain this my last will 
and testament.  That is to say as touching such worldly estate 
wherewith it hath pleased kind providence to bless me with, I give, 
devise and dispose of the same in the following manner and form.  
First I give and bequeath to Tomsen my dearly beloved wife all and 
singularly all my right and title of the lott of land I now possess 
together with all my household goods and moveable effects.  Also 
I give and bequeath to my son Leonard one shilling, also I give and 
bequeath to my son John one shilling, also I give and bequeath to my 
daughter Mary one shilling, also I give and bequeath to my daughter 
Betsy one shilling, also I give and bequeath to my son James one 
shilling, also I give and bequeath to my son Barton one shilling, 
also I give and bequeath to my son William one shilling, also I 
give and bequeath to my daughter Charity one shilling.  I give and 
bequeath to my son Claiborn one shilling, also I give and bequeath 
to my son Lewis one shilling, also I give and bequeath to my son 
Enoch one shilling, also I give and bequeath to my daughter Frances 
one shilling which they are to receive from my dearly beloved wife 
Tomsen after my decease.  Also I do likewise constitute, make and 
ordain my dearly beloved wife Tomsen executrix of this my last will 
and testament and I do hereby utterly disallow, revoke and disannul 
all and every other former testaments, wills, legacies, bequests and 
executors by me in any way before named, willed and bequeathed.  
Ratifying and confirming this and no other to be my last will and 
testament, witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal 
this fifth day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand 
seven hundred and ninety six.  <BR>

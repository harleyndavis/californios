Margaret Smoot&#0146;s Will&nbsp; |  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In the name of God Amen, I Margaret Smoot, administratrix and legal representative of 
John Smoot dec<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>d</SUP></FONT> being weak in body but firm in mind do make this my last will and 
testament.  Witnesseth that after all my just debts are paid, I will to the Court of Fauquier 
County and the State of Virginia my two old slaves to be free and for said court to 
approve some person to be guardians for them and to see to supporting them out of the 
proceeds of my estate after my debts are paid.  And my man Jack I desire to set free and I 
will him to Walter McCoy of Fauquier County Va to stand as master and guardian for 
said Jack and hire him out for wages or to keep him himself and to pay him for his labor 
and out of his wages the said McCoy is to keep a fee for his services as guardian for him 
the said Jack.  And if the said Jack can&#0146;t remain free in this Commonwealth the said 
McCoy or the Court of Fauquier County is to pursue the course the legislature has 
adopted for the emancipation of slaves by hiring said Jack out until he accumulates a sum 
sufficient to emigrate him to some of the colonies.  And I will my two men George and 
Jack one of my beds to be divided between said George and Jack, and the surviving one 
to have both halves of the bed.  And after those items are complied with, if there is any of 
my estate remaining, I will unto Alexander S. Murphy seventy five dollars and my sorrel 
mare and her two colts that I claim I have in possession of Elias Murphy, I give unto 
Alexr S. Murphy to have and to hold the same and I appoint Thomas Wigfield my 
administrator.  As witness my hand and seal this 7<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>th</SUP></FONT> day 
of June in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty two.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The inventory and appraisal of Margaret Smoot&#0146;s estate was reported in court 
January 17, 1843 and recorded in Will Book 19, page 15-16.  It included miscellaneous 
household items, a wagon, horses and cows, 30&#0189; barrels of corn, three stacks of wheat, 
two stacks of oats, and three Negroes, Jack valued at $300 and George and Eve of no 
value.  The only real estate included in the inventory was 100 acres of leased land, called 
the Heaton lot, on which her house stood, valued at $75. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Margaret Smoot&#0146;s property was sold on January 17, 1843.  The list of buyers 
was recorded in Will Book 19, pages 230-232 on August 26, 1845.  There were no 
Smoot&#0146;s among the purchasers.  Mary Barbee hired the Negro man Jack for the year 1843 
for $40, and John S. Rice paid $68.25 for the leased land.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   At the August 1846 court, it was ordered that John Marr, one of the Master 
Commissioners of the court, state and adjust the account of James Barbee, Administrator 
of the estate of Margaret Smoot dec<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>d</U></SUP></FONT> (Will Book 20, page 243, reported 
February 22, 
1847).  Two of the expenses on the account for 1845 were $5 for a house and lot for 
George and Eve, and $3.75 for 12 yards of cotton and 3&#0190; bushels of corn for them.  
Margaret Smoot&#0146;s estate was owed $183.98&#0189;, including Jack&#0146;s wages for 1844-1846.  
Marr concluded his report by saying &#0147;it may become necessary to separate his [Jack&#0146;s 
accounting] lines from the estate of Margaret Smoot dec<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><U>d</U></SUP></FONT> according to 
the provisions of 
the will.&#0148;  <BR>

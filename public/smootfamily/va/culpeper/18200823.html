<B><I>Elkwood &#038; Beverley Family Information</I></B>  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to John McGill, Robert Beverely (&#0147;d. 4-12-1800&#0148;) 
owned &#0147; . . . In addition to &#0145;Blandfield&#0146;, . . . the &#0145;Elkwood 
tract&#0146; of 13,000 acres in Culpeper Co., which he left to his son Munford, who sold 
it in 1805 to Daniel Grinnon, who built &#0145;Presque Isle&#0146;, which is still standing 
and owned by the Willis family. &#0148; <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the arrangement between Munford Beverley and Daniel Grinnon, 
it is obvious the Beverley family were still involved in at least part of the Elkwood tract 
up to 1820. Additionally, John McGill identifies Byrd Beverley, Carter Beverley, and Munford 
Beverley, as three of Robert Beverley&#0146;s sixteen children . <BR><BR>

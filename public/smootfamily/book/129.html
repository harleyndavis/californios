EDWARD SMOOT<SUP>3</SUP><BR>
AND<BR>
HIS DESCENDANTS<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>Edward Smoot is the inferred son of Thomas Smoot who died intestate 
during 1668. He was apparently the youngest and for that reason he 
failed to share in the landed estate of his deceased father. He married 
shortly after he attained his majority, but before he could acquire an 
estate of his own he died leaving a young widow and infant children. His 
wife was Susan ----, no doubt a maiden of Pickawaxon Hundred, 
Maryland. One son is proved, while the others are assumed.</DD><BR>

3. Leonard Smoot. <BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Edward Smoot died sometime before 1702, his estate being small 
accounts for the fact that no administration was recorded in the orphan's 
court. His son Richard was bound to William Hawton, the community 
blacksmith, who mentioned in a court record that he had in his 
possession "property of Edward Smoot deceased".</DD><BR> 
<DD>His widow probably married John Mandell who was the guardian of 
Leonard Smoot. On April 14, 1705, John Mand1 entered the cattle mark 
for his son-in-law Leonard Smoot. This instrument, therefore, shows that 
the father of Leonard was deceased by this date and that his widow had 
remarried. Leonard Smoot was living at late as February 1734, when he 
leased for 15 years "Poppleton", lying in Charles County, from Judith 
Dutton.</DD><BR>
<DD>The parentage of Stringer Smoot is also inferred, but he belonged of the 
generation to be the son of Edward, and for other good reasons it is 
assumed that he was of this branch. On March 17, 1723, Stringer Smoot 
and John Fenwick were bondsmen for Leonard Green, the executor of 
Cuthbert Sewell, of St. Mary's County. Stringer Smoot was therefore of 
sufficient age and the holder of property in 1723. No further record of 
him has been found.</DD><BR><BR>

Richard Smoot<SUP>4</SUP><BR>
(169- - 17--)<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>Richard Smoot, son of Edward and Susan Smoot, was born in 
Pickawaxon Hundred, Charles County, Maryland. His father being seized 
of only a small estate at his death, Richard Smoot at a very tender age</DD><BR>

was bound to William Hawton, a blacksmith. In 1702 William Hawton 
by will bequeathed personal property to Richard Smoot, providing that 
his mother "Susan Smoot do make good and confirm the indenture" to 
his executor John Hawton. William Hawton furthermore stipulated that 
Richard Smoot should have two years of schooling when he reached 7 or 
8 years of age (which would indicate that he was of a very young age in 
1702), and that his cattle were to be marked for him at 16 years of age.<BR> 
<DD>Fifteen years later Richard Smoot was still a minor, for in 1717 John 
Hawton, blacksmith, and son of the above-named William, devised by 
will his servant Richard Smoot to his executor John Maddox as well as 
the estate of his said servant.</DD><BR> 
<DD>Richard Smoot was remembered in the will of Mrs. Sarah Maddox, dated 
April 29, 1760 . . . "I give and bequeathed to Richd Smoot who served 
his time with My Deceased Husband John Madox one feather Bed one 
pair Blanketts, one Rugg and four head of Cattle to him and his heirs 
forever, Provided he be Living at my Death But if he be Dead I will the 
same to my Executor hereafter Mentioned".</DD><BR> 
<DD>Richard Smoot, according to the tax list of 1783, was without land but he 
possessed 3 horses, 9 heads of cattle, no slaves, and had eight persons in 
his household. At the first census of 1790, he had three women at home 
and no slaves. He was not listed in the 1800 census.</DD><BR>
<DD>In the same hundred, where Richard Smoot was domiciled, was William 
Smoot who also possessed no land, but in 1783 he had 3 horses, 7 heads 
of cattle, 2 slaves, and eight persons in his family. He apparently died 
before 1790, for in that year Mary Smoot, presumably his widow, was 
the head of a family with another woman comprising her household, and 
2 slaves. In 1800 Mary Smoot was still the head of a family, being more 
than 45 years of age, with 3 slaves. In 1810 she was probably living with 
her daughter, for one does not find her as the head of a family.</DD><BR> 
<DD>Her will was dated January 27, 1813, and proved February 9, 1813, in 
Charles County by John Weems McPherson, William McPherson, and 
Samuel S. Adams. She devised personalty to her granddaughter Mary 
Abigail Waters, and the residue of her estate to her daughter Sylvia 
Waters. She named her son-in-law John Waters as the executor.</DD><BR> 
<DD>It can be assumed from the tax list of 1783 that both Richard and William 
had one or more sons. All Smoots listed as heads of families in 1790 and 
1800, however, can more or less be satisfactorily placed, therefore, it is 
believed that if there were any male issues of Richard and William (the 
latter was probably a son of Richard) that they left</DD><BR>

Maryland and settled elsewhere. The fact that their children can not be 
determined accounts for the number of Smoots of the next generation 
living in the frontier counties of Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina, 
whose lines can not be established beyond this point.<BR>
<DD>About the fifth generation, there was an Anne Smoot, beloved by Joshua 
Radcliffe, who in 1759 became the mother of his natural daughter, 
Amelia Smoot.</DD><BR>

Charles County, in the year 1697, according  to deposition. In 1724 he, with James Waters, was 
bondsman for Rebecca  Tyre, when she administered on the estate of John Glass, likewise, in  
1726 he, with Samuel Love, was bondsman for Anne Kingsland at the  administration of the estate 
of William Kingsland.  Before November 13, 1728, Thomas Smoot married Abigail ---- who  assigned 
her dower when he deeded "Smoot's Chance" to his brother  Charles. At the establishment of Trinity 
Parish in 1753, the plantation of  Thomas Smoot lay in the newly created parish, and there the 
births of his  younger children are recorded.</DD><BR><BR>  <BLOCKQUOTE> Children of Thomas and

5 boys.  Both census schedules show him to be a fair owner of slaves.</DD><BR> <DD>Unfortunately, the

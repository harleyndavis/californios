WILLIAM SMOOT, GENT. <SUP>3</SUP><BR>
AND<BR>
HIS DESCENDANTS<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>William Smoot, son of Thomas and Jane (Batten) Smoot, was born 
during 1656 in Pickawaxon Hundred, Charles County, Maryland. On 
October 30, 1671, he as the eldest son and heir of Thomas Smoot, 
deceased, of Charles County. received a warrant for 250 acres of land to 
be known as "Smoot's Chance". One hundred and fifty acres had 
previously been returned in the name of Thomas Smoot, while the 
remaining 100 acres had been assigned to him by Robert Ellis, of St. 
Mary's County, who had received rights thereof by assignment from 
Robert Smith and David Smith, due them for services performed in the 
Province. In November 1681, he received 140 pounds of tobacco for 
deeds of public service, believed to be performed during a punitive 
expedition against the Indians.</DD><BR> 
<DD>In May 1683, William Smoot conveyed to his "brother" Thomas Smoot 
for 10,000 pounds of tobacco land formerly granted John Goldsmith, of 
St. Mary's County, lately deceased, lying on the west side of Wicomico 
River near the head of Smoot's Branch. In October of the same year, he 
deeded to Humphrey Warren for 7,000 pounds of tobacco "The Hills" of 
240 acres on the Wicomico except that portion which formerly was sold 
to Richard Smoot.</DD><BR> 
<DD>On August 5, 1683. William Smoot and Anne his wife conveyed to 
William Newman for 8,000 pounds of tobacco "Wicomico Fields 
Relations" which had been resurveyed by Captain Randolph Brandt, 
lying in Pickawaxon Hundred, but which was then a portion of a tract 
granted to William Smoot by patent. On August 9, 1684, William Smoot 
and Anne his wife deeded to Captain Randolph Brandt a portion of 
"Wicomico Fields". On August 12, of the same year, William Smoot sold 
to Samuel Luckett for 5,000 pounds of tobacco land adjoining "Johnson's 
Choice" and adjacent to the lands laid out for George Goodrick. 
In April 1689, William Smoot sold another portion of "Wicomico 
Fields", described as his dwelling plantation, to his kinsman Edward 
Smoot for 24,000 pounds of tobacco. The deed stated that it adjoined the 
land conveyed to William Newman and Captain Humphrey Warren. The 
conveyance was witnessed by Randall Bryant, Thomas Gibbons, and 
Elizabeth Butler.</DD>

<DD>William Smoot in some manner sustained financial reverses, as is evident 
by his numerous conveyances over a period of a few years, perhaps 
through the unsuccessful law suits emanating from his uncle's estate and 
a libel action against Robert Yates. In 1690, however, "William Smoot, 
Gent." petitioned the court to operate an inn . . . "Whereas your petitioner 
descended and for an honest extraction his parents (when in being) lived 
both in good repute and credit among the whole neighborhood and by 
their indulgent care left him a sustenance for his support and his outgoing 
enjoyment and himself for sometime since their decease lived in good 
rank and fashion but since by the frowns of fortune reduced to a mean 
condition, he being willing by any lawful ways or means be may repair 
his fortune . . . Petitions to keep a house of entertainment to provide a 
subsistance for his wife and Children". The court granted him a license to 
maintain an inn paying a yearly fee of 1,200 pounds of tobacco. 
About this time the Northern Neck of Virginia offered opportunities to 
settlers, consequently having encountered unfortunate events in 
Maryland, William Smoot and his young family crossed over to 
Westmoreland County, Virginia, and settled in Copley Parish at a date 
prior to 1695.</DD><BR> 
<DD>Sometime after 1690 his wife Anne died, and he married secondly 
Eleanor ----. From his will, it would seem to indicate that his three 
daughters had obtained majority and therefore could easily be of the first 
union. His sons, being minors at his death, could possibly be of the 
second wife.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>On November 9, 1704, William Smoot, of Copley Parish, Westmoreland 
County, conveyed to Lawrence Pope, of Washington Parish same county, 
for 3,000 pounds of tobacco 100 acres of land lying partly in Copley and 
Washington Parishes, being part of a tract granted to William Smoot by a 
deed from the Proprietor's Office in August 1704 of escheated land from 
Alexander Gordon, late of Westmoreland County. Eleanor Smoot, his 
wife, waived her dower rights.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The will of William Smoot was dated April 12, 1706, and proved in 
Westmoreland County on April 30, 1707, by John Moore and John 
Veale. He bequeathed his two daughters, Sarah and Winifred, the</DD>

dwelling-plantation but Sarah was to have the portion on the river. In the 
event that they died without heirs, the plantation was to revert to Mary. 
The latter received 3,000 pounds of tobacco and a feather bed at 
marriage.<BR> 
<DD>He devised his wife, Eleanor, all land in Stafford County at Aquia to her 
and her heirs forever. His sons, William and Thomas, were willed certain 
personalty, but his wife was to have the "tuition" of his two sons until 21 
years of age.</DD><BR><BR> 
<DD>A deed in 1717 shows that his widow was unmarried and that a 
posthumous son was born after the writing of his will. Eleanor Smoot, on 
December 5, 1717, deeded to her son John Smoot in the presence of 
Nathaniel Pope, Rebecca Bryant, and John Elliot for natural love and 
affections certain goods and chattels at the age of 18 years. His widow, 
however, later married John Austin and lived in St. Mary's County, 
Maryland, where she died intestate in 1747.</DD><BR> 
<DD>His son Thomas returned to Maryland and died intestate and without 
issues in 1719. The inventory of his estate was signed by Barton Smoot 
and Barton Hungerford as kinsmen, with Edward Gardner as the 
administrator. The estate was appraised by Joseph Douglas and Thomas 
Hawes.</DD><BR><BR>

William Smoot<SUP>4</SUP><BR>
(16-- - 1784)<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>William Smoot, son of William, was born perhaps in Copley Parish, 
Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was a minor at the death of his 
father in 1707, and was placed under the guardianship of his believed 
mother until majority. In 1713, however, he was of sufficient age to 
witness a lawsuit Higgins vs. Vaughn in Westmoreland County.</DD><BR> 
<DD>He married Frances ----. The births of his children are recorded in 
North Farnham Parish, Richmond County, which shows that he left the 
domicile of his parents and settled in the former county. Furthermore, the 
births of his children show that he was beyond the age of forty at time of 
marriage.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>On March 28, 1719, William Smoot, of Westmoreland County, Virginia, 
conveyed to Barton Smoot, of Charles County, Maryland, for five 
shillings all claim to property within the Province of Maryland. It is 
therefore proved that William Smoot was of the Maryland family, and 
this deed of gift was probably his interest as well as that of his brothers 
and sisters in the estate of his brother Thomas Smoot who had recently 
died intestate in Maryland.</DD><BR> 
<DD>After the birth of his children, William Smoot moved to St. Peter's 
Parish, Northumberland County, Virginia, where he died at an advanced 
age.</DD><BR> 
<DD>His will dated August 28, 1782, was proved December 6, 1784, in 
Northumberland County. The land purchased from William Elliot and 
Peter Beshaugh was to be divided equally between his grandchildren--
William Smoot Bryant and Betty Bryant, children of his daughter 
Eleanor. The plantation in Northumberland County was devised to his 
son John, whereas his granddaughter ---- Stott was willed the plantation 
which had been purchased from William Mason.</DD><BR> 
<DD>Lishay Bryant was to have the use of 10 acres in Northumberland County 
adjacent to Thaddeus Forrest during life then to his son John Smoot. 
Nancy Austin Everet received personalty, and Betty Brown 
Vanderlandinggham was willed the plantation in Richmond County 
during life then to his son John Smoot.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The residue of the estate was to be divided among his three children, 
Eleanor Bryant, Nancy Stott (Stoll), and John Smoot. His friends Thomas 
Coleman, Thomas Walker, and John Abbey were named as executors. 
Thomas Coleman and John Abbey relinquished the executorship which 
was later granted to his widow Frances Smoot.</DD><BR> 
<DD>His son John Smoot died without issues in Northumberland County. His 
will, dated October 2, 1792, was proved November 12, 1792, by Mary 
Stephens, John Bryant, and George Shearly. He named his widow Milly 
Smoot and bequeathed her the entire estate during widowhood then to his 
sister Nelly Bryant, except that part of his estate which came to him by 
his wife. His niece Anne Stoll was to have one year of schooling at the 
age of twelve, paid from the proceeds of his estate. He named his friends, 
Thomas Williams and Bryant Phillipp, the executors.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>John Austin, the step-father of John Smoot, died in St. Mary's County, 
his will being proved on July 16, 1733. He bequeathed his "godson" 
Austin Sanford Smoot the dwelling-plantation, but in the event of his 
death during minority then to his "sons-in-law" John Smoot and William 
Harrison. His wife Eleanor, however, was to enjoy the use of the 
dwelling until his godson attained majority. The two sons-in-law were 
devised 1,000 acres of land on Aquia Creek in Stafford County, Virginia. 
His widow and John Smoot administered on the estate.<SUP>1</SUP></DD><BR> 
<DD>The first wife of John Smoot lived perhaps only a short time, inasmuch 
as by 1734, John Smoot had become the administrator of Robert Crane, 
late of St. Mary's, by marrying the latter's widow. Accordingly on Mary 
20, 1734, John Smoot and Sarah his wife closed the estate of Robert 
Crane, when the balance of &#0163;214/10/6 3/4 was distributed to the widow 
and the following children, all minors--William, Thomas, Robert, and 
Mary Anne Crane.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>In 1738 John Smoot patented "Smoot's Marsh" of 31 acres lying on 
Herring Creek in St. Mary's County, which was augmented in 1746 by a 
survey of 31 acres known as "Smoot's Marsh Rectified". These tracts 
later were possessed by John Crane who in 1793 conveyed them to 
Henry Watts.</DD><BR> 
<DD>In 1747 John Smoot appeared in court as the administrator of his 
mother's estate, Eleanor Austin, late of St. Mary's County. No inventory 
nor administration accounts, however, are on file at Annapolis.</DD><BR>
________________<BR>
<DD><SUP>1</SUP>It is sometimes thought that John Smoot married a daughter of 
John Austin, but in the early eighteenth century "son-in-law" signified stepson. 
Furthermore, if John Smoot had married a daughter of John Austin, the latter would 
have referred to him as grandson instead of godson.</DD>

<DD>On March 26, 1750, John Smoot conveyed the land which he inherited 
from his step-father to John Dalton, Merchant, of Fairfax County, 
Virginia, and which has been willed in fee simple by his father to his 
mother Eleanor in 1707. The land was described as 407 acres situated 
formerly in Stafford County, but now in Fairfax County upon Tuskarora 
Branch, adjoining the land of William Chandler.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The second wife of John Smoot was deceased by 1752, for she failed to 
share in the estate of her son William Crane. On August 24, 1752, 
Thomas Crane, the eldest son of Sarah, rendered the final account on the 
estate of his brother William Crane, at which time &#0163;145/13/7 3/4 were 
distributed to the following representatives described as "brothers of the 
deceased" Thomas Crane of full age; Robert Crane and John Smoot 
about 15 years of age; George Smoot about 10 years; Cuthbert Smoot 
about 8 years; and Caleb about 5 years. John Reeder and William 
Morgan were sureties for the administrator.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The fact that Austin Sanford Smoot was not an heir of William Crane 
proves that he was not of the same mother. Under the English common 
law half brothers of the same mother shared equally. 
John Smoot took upon himself a third wife, but her identity remains a 
mystery to her many decendants. It can be assumed that she was a 
maiden of St. Mary's County.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>The will of John Smoot Sr. was dated October 26, 1789, and proved in 
St. Mary's County by John Horn Abell, Mary Bean, and John Fenwick of 
John. Peculiarly, he deeded no land but a large number of negroes and 
household furniture. Negroes and other personal property were 
bequeathed to his sons; Caleb, William, Thomas, Hezekiah, and 
Alexander; daughters Eleanor Price. Anne Barnhouse, and Elizabeth 
Smoot; and grandson John Smoot Price. A negro was devised to his 
granddaughter Auny Smoot, but in the event that she died before 
majority then to her sisters Susannah and Eleanor Smoot. A bequest was 
made to another granddaughter Mary Smoot. One shilling each was left 
to the following grandchildren--Barton Smoot, James Smoot, John 
Smoot, George Smoot, William Read Smoot, and Sarah Smoot. The 
crops were to be divided between his two children Hezekiah Smoot and 
Elizabeth Smoot.</DD><BR><BR>

Austin Sanford Smoot<SUP>5</SUP><BR>
(1727 - 17--)<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>Austin Sanford Smoot, the eldest son of John, was born about 1727 in St. 
Mary's County, Maryland. He was, however, of age in 1748, when he 
was the administrator de bonis non of the estate of Stephen Mackey, late 
of St. Mary's County. Robert Hagan and Thomas Biscoe were his 
bondsmen. From this fact, it has led to the inference, though proof is 
lacking, that he married into the Mackey or McKay family, and that 
Macky Smoot of the next generation was his son. If such be the case, the 
following are his children.</DD><BR><BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<DD>Austin Sanford Smoot predeceased his father, and it is noted that none of 
the grandchildren mentioned in the father's will can be satisfactorily 
placed as those of Austin. John Smoot, it must be remembered, 
bequeathed no realty, and inasmuch as Austin Smoot inherited the 
dwelling-plantation of his godfather John Austin, the father probably 
considered that these grandchildren were well provided for, and therefore 
failed to make them heirs of his personal estate.</DD><BR> 
<DD>Austin Sanford Smoot was not the head of a family at the first census, 
but Anne Smoot with a male less than 16 years of age (Mackey) was 
probably his widow.</DD>

<DD>Austin Sanford Smoot in March 1778, took the Oath of Allegiance in St. 
Mary's County, his name appearing on the list of "the worshipful Bennett 
Biscoe's Returns".<SUP>3</SUP></DD><BR> 
<DD>Prior to this date, however, "Sanford Smoot" with Benjamin Morgan and 
Thomas Austen testified to the validity of the will of Sarah Thomas, 
widow of St. Mary's County. John Horn Abel appraised the estate. 
Inasmuch as the administration accounts of St. Mary's between the years 
1777 and 1806 were destroyed, it has been difficult to prove the 
approximate date of his death or his heirs.</DD><BR> 
<DD>Mackey Smoot, the believed son of Austin Smoot, was not listed as the 
head of a family until 1820, at which time the census schedule showed 
that he was born prior to 1775 and had in his household a female over 45 
years of age, and a male between the ages of 18 and 26 years.</DD><BR> 
<DD>Between 1813 and 1818 Mackey conveyed "Poplar Neck" to William 
Thomas; an unnamed tract to Thomas Bennett and Rebecca L. Green; 
"St. Jerome's Plains" to Mary Thomas and others; and "Elizabeth Manor" 
to William Dixon and others.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The will of Mackey Smoot was dated July 21, 1829, and proved in St. 
Mary's County on December 21, 1829, by Bennett Bean, Uriah Tippett, 
and William Clarke. He bequeathed his realty to his sister, Mary Smoot, 
during life then to George Beal for the services rendered. The residue 
was willed to the children of his sister, Elizabeth Milburn, residing in the 
State of North Carolina.</DD><BR> 
<DD>His personal property was offered for sale on February 10, 1830, when it 
brought $117.62 1/2. Among the purchasers were Hezekiah Smoot and 
Mary Smoot. His realty, lying in the vicinity of St. Inigoes, was 
appraised in 1831. Among the out houses were a shoe and a blacksmith 
shop. One account of his personal estate displayed a balance of 
$3,284.84. The final distribution was not made until 1850, when the 
unnamed children of Elizabeth Milburn, of North Carolina, were the only 
representatives.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>It is probable that he had a son Hezekiah who either predeceased him or 
was not a resident of Maryland at the time of his death. One Hezekiah 
Smoot was drafted in St. Mary's County during July 1813 for services in 
the War of 1812, and inasmuch as Hezekiah Smoot of John was past 50 
years of age, it is concluded that the soldier was of a younger generation. 
He was assigned to the company of Captain Richard Clarke of the 
Second Maryland Regiment commanded by Colonel Fenwick. Most of 
the time he performed guard duty on the shore between St. Inigoes and 
Cedar Point. He was discharged October 30, 1813.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The will of Hezekiah Smoot was dated August 26, 1834, and proved in 
Charles County on September 9, the same year, by Matilda E. Wilson, 
Robert F. M. Lyons, and George T. St. Clair, with Richard M. Rencher as 
the executor. He named only two heirs, William Renscher and Thomas 
Lloyd, both grandsons.<DD>

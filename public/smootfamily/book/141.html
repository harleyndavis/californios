GEORGE SMOOT<SUP>5</SUP><BR>

HIS DESCENDANTS<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<DD>George Smoot, son of John and Sarah Smoot, was born about 1742 in St. 
Mary's County, Maryland.<SUP>1</SUP> He married Anne, daughter of John and 

Mary Magdaline Beale, of St. Mary's County.</DD><BR> 
<DD>John Beale dated his will May 1, 1792, it being proved on August 7, 
same year, by John Horn Abel, Richard Fenwick, and Robert Hendley. 
He bequeathed his grandsons John and George Smoot, a tract of land in 
Culpeper County, Virginia, but "my dear daughter Anne Smoot to have 
use of it during her natural life". He devised William Beale (named as 
grandson in distribution) land purchased from Joseph Arthis but in the 
event of his death without issues then to Josiah Beale, and in case of the 
latter's death without issues then to the testator's grandson William Read 
Smoot. Other heirs were his grandson Josiah Beale who received the 
dwelling-plantation in St. Mary's County, son Josiah Beale, and 
grandchildren Sarah Beale, Mary Smoot, and Sarah Smoot. The estate 
was distributed to the heirs on January 16, 1794, by Mary Magdaline 
Beale, the executrix.</DD><BR><BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<DD>George Smoot died intestate perhaps prior to the year 1778. The fact that 
the administration accounts of St. Mary's County are missing between 
1777-1806 prevents the obtainment of the approximate date of his death. 
His name does not appear with his father and brothers as taking the Oath 
of Fidelity in 1778 nor is his name among the militiamen of the county in 
1780. These facts tend to indicate that he died before these dates.</DD><BR>________________<BR>
<DD><SUP>1</SUP> Abraham Smoot, the Mormon, stated that his paternal 
grandfather was John Smoot, but the records of St. M. Co. dispute this assertion. 
The Jenifer-Smoots of Madison Co., Va., who kept in closer contact with their Maryland 
kinsmen recorded among their private papers that they were descended from 
George Smoot and Anne Beale his wife. Furthermore, the Beale traditions carried 
by them are substantiated by source records in St. M. Co.</DD>

John Smoot<SUP>6</SUP><BR>
(1765 - 1842)<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<DD>John Smoot, son of George and Anne (Beale) Smoot, was born about 
1765 in St. Mary's County, Maryland. He married first according to 
tradition Elizabeth Jenifer, the union occurring about 1791, and then 
settled in the southern portion of Culpeper County, Virginia.</DD><BR><BR>

Children of John and Elizabeth (Jenifer) Smoot<BR><BR>
1. Daniel Jenifer Smoot married Harriet Medley. q.v. <BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>On January 1, 1793, as residents of Brumfield Parish, Culpeper County, 
John Smoot and Elizabeth his wife, and George Smoot conveyed to 
Thomas Canady 84 acres of land lying in Culpeper County, which had 
been inherited by them from their maternal grandfather. Inasmuch as 
their mother Anne Smoot was to enjoy the use of it during her lifetime 
and she was not a party to the conveyance, it was therefore probable that 
she was deceased by that date. All three Smoots made their mark. The 
witnesses to the transfer were Wharton Canady, Charles Young, and 
Salla Young.</DD><BR> 
<DD>In 1796 Brumfield Parish of Culpeper County was organized into 
Madison County, consequently John Smoot became a resident ipso facto 
of the newly organized county. The records of St. Mark's Parish, 
Culpeper County, show the marriage of a John Smoot and Anne Canady 
in 1798. It is known that his wife Elizabeth died early, and inasmuch as 
the Canadys were his neighbors, it is probable that this marriage can be 
credited to him. If so, the union was of short duration. It is known, 
however, that he married Lucy Buckner, born March 3, 1786, daughter of 
George and Margaret (Stanley) Thornton, of Orange (now Greene) 
County, Virginia. The bond was secured in Orange County on June 9, 
1806, stating that the prospective bride was the daughter of George 
Thornton. William Buckner and Charles Thornton were the witnesses, 
with the latter as bondsman. The ceremony by the Rev. Isham Tatum, 
was reported in Madison County as occurring on June 12, 1806.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The census record of Madison County for 1830 shows that there were at 
least four sons and two daughters in his household--one son born 
between 1804-1810; two sons born between 1810-1820; two daughters 
born 1810-1820; and a son born 1825-1830. The following therefore is 
not a complete list of the children.</DD>

<DD>On November 13, 1835, John Smoot and Lucy his wife conveyed land 
lying on the south side of Haphazard Mill Road to Landon Bates, and on 
the same day they deeded 180 acres of land to Daniel Jenifer Smoot for a 
consideration of $600. About this time he migrated to Christian County, 
Kentucky, taking his younger children with him. He died July 15, 1842,

<DD>George Smoot, son of George and Anne (Beale) Smoot, was born in St. 
Mary's County, Maryland, before the year 1765, according to subsequent 
census records. By the will of his maternal grandfather he received 
jointly with his brother John, land in Culpeper County, Virginia. On 
January 19, 1793, both recorded as residents of Culpeper, they sold this 
land to Thomas Canady which was described as 84 acres lying in 
Brumfield Parish.</DD><BR>
<DD>Sometime after this date George Smoot migrated to Kentucky and settled 
in that part of Franklin County which in 1819 became Owen County. 
Here about 1806 he married Anne, the daughter of William and Jemina 
(Owen) Rowlett, born May 2, 1787, and as tradition has it in Virginia. It 
is said that George Smoot died in Owen County during 1823. His widow 
remarried and died March 16, 1871.</DD><BR><BR>

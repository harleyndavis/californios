WILLIAM SMOOT<SUP>4</SUP><BR>
AND<BR>
HIS DESCENDANTS<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<DD>William Smoot, son of Thomas and Elizabeth (Barton) Smoot, was born 
in William and Mary Parish, Charles County, Maryland, towards the 
latter part of the seventeenth century, being a minor at the death of his 
father in 1704. He received 200 acres of unnamed land by the will of his 
parent, but somehow at his death his estate seemed to have consisted 
chiefly of personal property. The name of his wife is unknown.</DD><BR><BR>

Children of William Smoot<BR><BR>
1. Thomas Smoot, no further record.<BR>
2. John Smoot married Mary ----. q.v.<BR><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>The will of William Smoot was dated November 9, 1726, and proved in 
Charles County November 18, 1726, by Thomas Morris, Elizabeth 
Weedon, and Thomas Hawton. He bequeathed his son Thomas 
personalty at the age of 21 years and placed him under the guardianship 
of Mark Penn, naming the latter as the executor of his estate. To his son 
John, he devised personalty at the age of 21, and placed him under the 
guardianship of John Wilder.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The inventory of his personal estate was taken on March 15, 1726/27, 
and appraised at &#0163;30/13/7 by William Hawton and Robert Yates. 
William Barton and Thomas Smoot signed as the nearest of kin, and 
Thomas Smoot as the greatest creditor.</DD><BR>
<DD>Prior to the inventory, however, his will was presented to the court on 
November 19, 1726, by Mark Penn as the executor, and Matthew Dutton 
and William Cage as his sureties.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>John Smoot, born about 1712, was a minor at the death of his father 
William Smoot in 1726, and according to the terms of his parent's will, 
he was placed under the guardianship of John Wilder. The father of the 
boy apparently lost his land early in life and inasmuch as his inheritance 
was small, John Smoot at majority moved westward to the frontier of</DD>

the Province where land warrants were freely granted to encourage 
settlement.<BR> 
<DD>His migration can best be placed at 1730 and therefore he was one of the 
pioneers of what is now Montgomery County. In 1732 he patented 
"Bell's Design" of 100 acres, and in the same year with J. Collier and J. 
Holmard he patented "Partnership" consisting of 50 acres, and then 
"Elizabeth" of 50 acres--all three tracts then lying in Prince George 
County. He married Mary ----, whom he perhaps met on the frontier.

</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<DD>John Smoot with Thomas Charter was bondsman when Mary Snow, of 
Prince Georges County, administered on the estate of John Snow. On 
March 20, 1738, John Smoot conveyed "Partnership" and "Elizabeth", 
that is, his share in the two tracts, to James Holmead. At that time no 
wife waived her dower. John Beale and John Hepburn witnessed the 
conveyance.</DD><BR>
<DD>The will of John Smoot was dated October 20, 1747, and admitted to 
probate in Prince Georges County by Solomon Stimton, James Harrison, 
and Thomas Birdwistle. He devised his son John 100 acres of "Beall's 
Design", his son Edward 100 acres of "Crumford", and various 
personalty to his wife Mary and his daughter Mary.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The inventory of his personal effects was taken on June 28, 1748, with 
Jeremiah Neal and Matthew Edwards signing as kinsmen, presumably his 
widow's relatives or husbands of unproved sisters, as it is believed that he 
had no blood kinsmen living at that time in the western part of the 
Province. His widow signed the papers as executrix, with John Crompkin 
and James Harrison as her sureties.</DD><BR> 
<DD>His widow later married Thomas Fletshall who rendered an account on 
the estate during 1752 in Frederick County. At the June Court of 1755 
John Smoot Jr. petitioned the court stating that Thomas Fletchell had the 
estate of Edward and Barton Smoot in his hands and "is now going to 
move to Carolina", therefore prayed partition of the estate on behalf of 
the two orphans.</DD>

John Smoot<SUP>6</SUP><BR>
(17-- - 1808)<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<DD>John Smoot, eldest son of John and Mary Smoot, was born in Prince 
Georges (Montgomery) County, Maryland, about 1738, or perhaps a little 
earlier as he was of sufficient age in 1755 to petition the court for a 
division of his father's estate. In 1753 he sold to his step-father Thomas 
Fletcher (the spelling occurred in various ways on the records) "Beal's 
Design" for 3,000 pounds of tobacco. The tract adjoined "Conclusion" 
and "Crumford". Shortly after he demanded the partition of his father's 
estate on behalf of his younger brothers, it is believed that he, with a 
party of other adventurers, migrated to what was then Orange County, 
later Hampshire County, Virginia. His will was dated December 11, 
1807, and proved in Hampshire County on April 18, 1808, naming the 
following children. </DD><BR><BR>

March 8, 1828, in Harrison County, by George W. Craner and Isaac

<DD>Richard Smoot, son of William, was born perhaps on the other side and
was brought to America by his parent at an early age. His father
transported him to Maryland in 1646 which would seem to indicate that he
were a minor at that time.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The fact that a warrant on September 26, 1673, was issued to him for 200
acres of land, 100 acres of which was due for "time of service of
himself and wife Elizabeth performed in the Province" has become a
subject of much controversy. It is sometime thought that he left the
Province, perhaps to Virginia where he married, and was returned to
Maryland as an indenture by an enterpriser. This is highly possible, but
the more logical conclusion is that he, wishing to reach perfection in a
trade, apprenticed himself to a local artisan in the Province, an act
which usually took the legal procedure of an indenture. While serving
his period of apprenticeship, he married a redemptioner and consequently
he was entitled to her land at the completion of her services. The other
100 acres of land to which he was entitled in 1673, were from assignment
of Thomas Notley, due the latter for the transporting of John Reed and
Robert Collingswood.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>Richard Smoot established his seat on the tract known as "The Hills" in
Pickawaxon Hundred, where he eventually became the proprietor of one of
the largest landed estates in the hundred. About 1650 he received from
his father 200 acres of land adjoining the estate of Francis Pope on the
Wicomico River, which he later conveyed to his neighbor Giles
Thompkinson. In 1656 he assigned a portion of "Attwickes' Purchase" on
the Wicomico, which had been patented by his father, to Thomas Mitchell
who later conveyed to Humphrey Attwickes. The latter in 1662 sold to
Thomas Peircy, at which time the transfer was acknowledged by his wife
Elizabeth Attwickes. This tract in 1676 became the</DD>

subject of a suit in chancery, with Bridget Legatt, widow of John
Legatt, as the defendant. In 1667 Richard Smoot patented "Free Booty" of
50 acres lying on the west side of the Wicomico near the land of Thomas
Smoot. In 1674 he received a warrant for "Smoot's Purchase" of 100 acres
in St. Mary's County.<BR> 

<DD>At the lawsuit emanating from the estate of Captain William Batten in
1671/2, Richard Smoot served on the jury.</DD><BR>

<DD>The will of Richard Smoot was dated April 23, 1676, and admitted to
probate in Charles County on October 31, 1676, by Henry Henley and
William Browne, with "brothers William Barton and Robert Rowland" as the
overseers. He bequeathed to his eldest son, Richard, the dwelling
plantation at the age of 21 years, and Edward an 100-acre portion of
"Smoot's Purchase" at majority. The residue of his estate was to be
divided among his five named children--Richard, Edward, Elizabeth,
William, and Eleanor.</DD><BR>
<DD>At the court held in Charles County during January 1676/77, Elizabeth
Smoot "by the consent of Captain William Barton one of the overseers of
the estate of Richard Smoot late of Charles County deceased" was placed
under the guardianship of Elizabeth wife of Henry Bonner "till she
arrives at the age of 16 years or marriage and said Elizabeth Bonner to
learn the orphan to read and write and not to work without the house".
At the same court Edward Smoot chose Thomas Taylor, and Richard Smoot
that of Walter Davis.</DD><BR>
<DD>On January 20, 1677, Walter Davis of Charles County, the greatest
creditor of Richard Smoot, appeared in court and declared that the
overseers "would not to further intermeddle with goods". Furthermore, he
stated that Richard Smoot, the eldest son, was then of age sufficient to
select his own guardian and that he had chosen him. The judge ordered
that the goods and chattels of Richard Smoot be transferred to Walter
Davis. </DD><BR> 
<DD>The inventory of the personal estate of Richard Smoot Sr. was appraised
by John Cage and George Creducle on May 15, 1677, with William Barton
Jr., as the executor. </DD><BR> 
<DD>The following letter of the same date to Walter Davis was signed by
Philip Calvert: "I understand that William Barton Jr. hath intermeddled
with goods of Richard Smoot and not fit to administer. He brought an
inventory which I ordered to be recorded ... The orphans are under your
care now and I desire you to look after them".</DD><BR> 

<DD>On July 18, 1677, Captain Humphrey Warren in court exhibited the bond of
Walter Davis, the administrator of Richard Smoot Sr., deceased, with
John Hater and Robert Inglesby as the sureties.</DD>

<CENTER>Richard Smoot<SUP>3</SUP><BR>
                            (1663 - 1734)</CENTER><BR><BR>

<DD>Richard Smoot, son of Richard and Elizabeth Smoot, was born about 1663
in Pickawaxon Hundred, Charles County, Maryland. By the will of his
father in 1677, he was bequeathed, as the eldest son, the dwelling
plantation "The Hills", but somehow this tract of 240 acres subsequently
became the property and seat of Captain Humphrey Warren II. In 1711
Richard Smoot with James Walker was bondsman for his sister Eleanor
Warren, the administratrix of Humphrey Warren III.</DD><BR> 

<DD>It is assumed that he was the Richard Smoot who settled in Prince
Georges County, where he died intestate in 1734. Letters of
administration were issued to his widow, Margaret Smoot, with John
Harris and Leonard Marbury as her bondsmen. It is believed that he
married late in life and that no children were born to the union.</DD><BR><BR> 

<CENTER>Edward Smoot<SUP>3</SUP><BR>
                            (16-- - 1707)</CENTER><BR><BR>

<DD>Edward Smoot, son of Richard and Elizabeth Smoot, was born probably at
"The Hills" in Pickawaxon Hundred, Charles County. In November 1681, he
with a number of others received from His Lordship's Treasury 110 pounds
of tobacco for "acts of public service", which is believed for his
participation in one of the early Indian campaigns.</DD><BR>
<DD>He married Lydia, daughter of George and Lydia (Ashcomb) Newman, but
then the widow of John Gee, late of St. Mary's County. Records show that
on February 25, 1684, the administration of the estate of John Gee was
granted to Edward Smoot who "marryed the widow of the said deceased".<BR><BR>

<DD>Edward Smoot died intestate. Letters of administration were issued on
July 15, 1707, to Gerard O'Cane who had married the widow. His personal
estate was appraised on August 16, 1707, by William Maddox and Richard
Morris. John Loftus was surety for the administrator.</DD><BR> 

<DD>At a subsequent rent roll, 200 acres of "Wicomico Fields" were possessed
by Gerard O'Cane and his wife Lydia, 100 acres by John Warren, and 200
acres by Colonel Contee.</DD><BR> 

<DD>By her third husband, Lydia Gee-Newman-O'Cane had at least two
children--Gerard II and Judith. Gerard O'Cane Sr. died intestate in
1713, when his step-son John Smoot was appointed administrator by the
court. John Wilder and Edward Ford offered bond. Within a short time his
widow died, thereupon her son John Smoot was named administrator. In
this instance John Wilder and William Derregoe were his bondsmen.</DD><BR>

<DD>An administration account shows that John Smoot while administrating on
the estate of Gerard O'Cane accounted for the money due from the
deceased (Gerard O'Cane) as the administrator of Edward Smoot as well as
disbursements to Eleanor Smoot daughter of Edward deceased, to Judith
O'Cane daughter of the deceased, and to James O'Cane "his son". From the
peculiar wording of the account, one would conclude that James was a son
by a previous marriage, yet no statement proves this fact.</DD><BR>

<DD>John Smoot in 1720 when he rendered an account on the estate of his
mother made the following statement ... "whereof he could render a
specific inventory and that he believes if any such there were that they
by mistake were appraised among the estate of Gerard O'Cane, her
deceased husband, who died but a small space before her".</DD><BR>

<DD>At this time Gerard O'Cane, the minor orphan, had been removed from the
guardianship of his half-brother and placed under his fullblood sister
Judith Dutton. The latter by that date had married Matthew Dutton, of
Charles County. Matthew Dutton died in 1734, naming in his will his
widow Judith, and sons Notley, Thomas, and Gerard, and an unborn child.
His widow on February 27, 1734, leased "Popleton" lying in Charles
County to Leonard Smoot. She by 1737 had married secondly John Penn.</DD><BR><BR>

John Smoot and Posthuma his wife conveyed to John Sanders for 7,500

willed Posthuma by her father and whereon Richard Coombs lately dwelt.

administrated on the estate of her husband John Lofton. He also was
bondman for William Derregoe when he administrated on the estate of John
Derregoe in 1719, for Matthew Wardeen in 1722 when he administrated on
Robert Cull's estate, and he with Matthew Dutton was bondsman for
Katherine Edwards when she administrated for Thomas Wakefield.</DD><BR> 

<DD>John Smoot maintained his seat at "Wicomico Fields" where he died
intestate during November 1727/8. The inventory of his personal estate
was taken in April 1728, with James Smith and Lydia Smoot signing as the
kinsmen. Mark Penn and Alexander Hanna were the greatest creditors. At
this date the widow had married John Groves who, as administrator,
certified to the inventory, stating that his wife, Posthuma Groves,
relict and administratrix of John Smoot' deceased, was "not capable of
riding at Present". Mark Penn and William Hawton were the bondsmen for
the administrators. At a subsequent rent roll of Charles County, John
Groves held a portion of "Wicomico Fields" for the orphans of John
Smoot.</DD><BR>

<DD>Posthuma Smoot-Groves outlived her second husband and rendered an
account on his estate in April 1750. She showed a disbursement to John
Smoot "being a part of his father's estate". The Groves representatives

aged 16 years.<SUP>1</SUP></DD><BR>

(1724 - 1795)<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>Edward Smoot, son of John and Posthuma (Ford) Smoot, was born at
"Wicomico Fields", Charles County, Maryland. On February 22, 1762, in
defining the boundary of his plantation he gave his age as 38 years,
therefore, placing his birth about the year 1724. He married first Miss
Chandler, according to a notation made in the Bible of his grandson.
Furthermore, a son of this marriage noted in his family Bible that he
was the child of Edward and Anne Smoot. From these references, we
consequently learn that his first wife was Anne Chandler. The Smoots and
the Chandlers were neighbors and friends and therefore it was natural
that a marriage between the two families would materialize.</DD><BR>

<DD>John Chandler was domiciled in Port Tobacco Hundred early in the
seventeen hundreds, though he married Anne Penn, sister to Mark Penn,
whose ancestral home was in Pickawaxon Hundred. The will of John
Chandler, proved in 1735, named his sons, John, William, Stephen, and
daughters, Sarah Hamill, Anne Chandler, and Mary Chandler. John and
Stephen settled on the Wicomico. Subsequently Stephen Chandler sued
Edward Smoot for possession of land in St. Mary's County. Although the
lawsuit failed to show the cause for legal action, it is concluded that
in some manner Edward Smoot through his wife was holding land previously
belonging to the Chandlers.</DD><BR></FONT>

<DD>Edward Smoot added to his estate from time to time both by patent and by
purchase. In 1755 he received a warrant, which was issued under the name
of "Wilder's Mistake", for an unclaimed tract of land amounting to 66
1/2 acres between his plantation and that of John Wilder. In 1764 he
patented "Sukey" of 22 acres, and in 1765 "Smoot's Trifle" of 3 3/4
acres.</DD><BR>

<DD>In 1764 Edward Smoot purchased from William Mitchell, of Prince William
County, Virginia, 153 acres of land lying in that county, the tract
being a portion of 300 acres bought by Luke Cannon from Thomas Young,
conveyed to Young by George Pemberton and conveyed to him by Charles
Sneed to whom the land had descended by inheritance.</DD><BR> 

<DD>On March 16, 1767, Edward Smoot, Merchant, and Mary Magdaline his wife
deeded to James Tippen, of Frederick County, Innholder, 76 acres of
land, being one-third of the dwelling-plantation of Benjamin Stoddert
called "Friendship" originally granted to Colonel Thomas Addison and
James Stoddert, and inherited by Edward and Mary Magdaline Smoot.</DD>

<DD>In 1770 Edward Smoot purchased from Philip Ludwell Lee 1,300 acres of
"Rehoboth", portion of an original tract of 2,300 acres lying on the
eastern side of the northwest fork of the Nanticoke River in Dorchester
County. The original patent was in the name of John Lee, of Virginia,
but later passed to his brother Richard Lee. </DD><BR>

<DD>The tax list of 1783 recorded him as a resident of William and Mary
Parish, stating that his seat "Wicomico Fields" had a "beautiful
location on the Wicomico River". His other taxable realty in that year
were "Wilder's Mistake", "Bullen" on the Potomac of 25 acres, "Bole's
Purchase" of 483 acres on the Potomac, and 50 acres of "Harrison's
Adventure".</DD><BR>

<DD>Edward Smoot was a communicant of the Parish Church, still standing at
Wayside, and shared a pew with Anne Smoot, according to the assignment
of 1752. Although his wife at this period was Anne, it was not
accustomed in that day to assign pews in the name of a wife.
Consequently, she was probably a maiden sister or a near kinswoman. </DD><BR> 

<DD>Edward Smoot took the Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity to the State of
Maryland during 1778. Record exists, however, of his having been
summoned by a commission of Charles County on the suspicion of
maintaining a correspondence with the enemy. The charge was dismissed
December 23, 1777, after he had given bond for his appearance at the
next county court. </DD><BR>

<DD>On June 14, 1785, he deeded to his son Edward Smoot for love and natural
affections a portion of "Rehoboth", lying at the mouth of Batchelor
Creek. Mary Magdaline Smoot, his wife, waived her dower. At one time he
was a magistrate of Charles County. </DD><BR>

<DD>The will of Edward Smoot was dated October 2, 1794, and proved in
Charles County on February 24, 1795, by J. Harris, Sarah Marshall, and
Henley Adams, with the widow and son Alexander Stoddert Smoot as the
executors. </DD><BR>

<DD>He confirmed the gifts, both real and personal, made to his deceased son
Edward and his heirs. To his son William Groves Smoot, he devised
personalty and confirmed the gifts already given him. To his grandson
Thomas, son of William Groves Smoot, he bequeathed several tracts of
land on which the latter was domiciled, with William Groves the
privilege of residing upon the land during life. </DD><BR>  

<DD>Henry was willed a portion of "Rehoboth" lying in Dorchester County. To
the heirs of his son John, he devised one guinea and confirmed the gifts
already bequeathed.</DD>

<DD>Alexander received after the death of his mother all land purchased from
Levy Chum, Philip Key, and Edward Gardner, being a portion of "Wicomico

also received 375 acres of "Indian Landing", lying on the southwest side
of the northwest fork of the Nanticoke River, in Dorchester County. </DD><BR>  

<DD>Benjamin Stoddert Smoot was bequeathed the dwelling-plantation, being a
portion of "Wicomico Fields", and two tracts purchased from Joseph
Scrogen known as "Harrison's Adventure" and "Scrogen's Grove", a tract
adjoining called "Wilder's Mistake", and the water mill. </DD><BR>

<DD>Daughters, Lydia Kennedy and Jannet Smoot, received certain articles and
one-half of the personal estate, the other half to be enjoyed by his
widow during life, then to his two sons--Alexander and Benjamin. His
granddaughters, Mary Smoot of Henry and Catherine Kennedy, were each
devised a negro. In the event that his daughter Mary was living at the
time of his death, she was to have #&0163;5 and the confirmation of gifts
already bequeathed. </DD><BR>

<DD>His executors were to sell "Lucky" and the proceeds were to be divided
between his two grandchildren--Elizabeth Smoot of William and Elizabeth
Kennedy of Clement--when they came of age. His wife, whom he named as
executrix with his son Alexander, died before the probation of the will,
inasmuch as on February 24, 1795, the court records refer to "Alexander
S. Smoot as the surviving executor". The inventory of the personal
effects was taken on June 14, 1796, with Benjamin S. Smoot and William
G. Smoot as the next of kin.</DD><BR> 

<DD>Court records show that Alexander Stoddert Smoot was made the guardian
of his brother and sister--Janet and Benjamin Stoddert. Citation was
issued at the court of 1797-1799 to Alexander Smoot, executor of Edward
Smoot, to show why he had failed to render a final account on the
estate.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>Being a younger son, John Smoot failed to share in the realty holdings
of his deceased father. In 1750, presumably shortly after he obtained
majority, he was devised his share of the personal estate by his mother.
He established his seat in Trinity Parish where the marriages of his two
daughters are recorded in the register. In 1766 he patented "Rogue's
Harbor" of 3 1/4 acres and two years later he received a warrant for
"Good Luck" to be surveyed into 44 acres. At the first census he was
presumably the John Smoot Sr. who was the head of a family with 2 males
over 16 years of age, 4 males under 16 years, 4 females, and 11 slaves. 
</DD><BR><DD>
He died intestate in Charles County. The court named his widow Anne
Smoot, the administratrix, while Neale H. Shaw and John E. Ford offered
bond. The inventory of his personal estate was taken on September 24,
1795, and appraised at #&0163;336/14/6. Horatio Smoot and John B. Wilder
signed as next of kin. The proceeds were distributed in 1806 among the
widow, the seven surviving children, and Eleanor Minitree
(granddaughter) daughter of Eleanor Minitree, deceased. 
</DD><BR><DD>
In 1800 his widow Anne Smoot was the head of a family in William and
Mary Parish, Charles County, with two males between the ages of 16 and
26, one female between the same ages, herself over 45, and 20 slaves.
She was not the head of a family at the next census.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>John Smoot settled about 1771 upon "Rehoboth" where he constructed
Liberty Hall a spacious Georgian mansion, now one of the show places of
Dorchester County. At the census of 1790, he had 41 negroes on his
plantation, being the largest slave owner in the county.</DD><BR> 

<DD>On May 20, 1778, John Smoot was commissioned a captain of the Third
Company of the Upper Battalion of Dorchester County Militia. He was in
service as late as April 1, 1780. His mercantile business maintained a
fleet of its own ships, some of which were captured by Tories during the
war. He was also a county magistrate and represented his district at the
first State Assembly of Maryland.<SUP>1</SUP></DD><BR>

<DD>John Smoot purchased from Eccleston Brown on July 12, 1793, "Sandy Hill"
on the upper side of the Northwest Fork Bridge (now Federalsburg,
Caroline County), running from the bridge south, then up the street
binding on far corner of "John Smoot's Store House". The title, however,
did not pass until April 13, 1796, when it was delivered to J. Douglas,
the administrator of his estate. </DD><BR> 

<DD>John Smoot before his death controlled a number of mercantile
establishments on the Eastern Shore--besides the store at Northwest Fork
Bridge, he had one at Crotchers' Ferry. In his concern at Vienna he had
Alexander Douglas as his partner, and then there was a lumber firm of
Douglas & Smoot, near his seat of "Rehoboth", where also stood a mill. </DD><BR> 

<DD>John Smoot negotiated his will on August 27, 1787, shortly after the
death of his first wife. He bequeathed the dwelling-plantation of 440
acres to his son John, also his merchandise interests. Other realty was
devised to his two children Catherine and Henry. He died on January 15,
1793, and was buried in the private burying ground at Liberty Hall. </DD><BR> 

<DD>In the meantime he had remarried and become the father of two additional
children, all of whom he failed to provide for either by a codicil or a
new will. In 1799 his widow married Thomas Jackson at Christ Church,
Cambridge, and with him instituted action in the courts for an equaled
distribution of the estate. </DD><BR>

<DD>Furthermore, another law suit developed over a portion of "Rehoboth"
about 1806, particularly that portion owned by Launcelot Lee who died
intestate about 17--, leaving his sister Amelia Lee his heir-at-law. The
latter afterwards married John Anderton, of Dorchester County, who
predeceased his wife. Amelia (Lee) Anderton by her will devised the
portion of "Rehoboth" to her namesake Amelia Lee Smoot who died
intestate, thereupon the land descended to her brother John Smoot and
her sister Catherine Cropper, wife of John Cropper. The suit showed that
Catherine had died during 1804, leaving Zadoc and Elizabeth Cropper as
her only heirs-at-law. </DD><BR>

<DD>The date of the erection and the builder of Liberty Hall, "Rehoboth", or
the Old Turpin Place, as the villagers of Dorchester County refer to it,
have been the subject of much controversy. Some of the chambers of
commerce on the Shore, tourist bureaus, and writers of Maryland claim
that it was constructed as early as 1742 by the Lees, others cite 1757.

built by her great-great grandfather John T. Smoot, but writers and
promoters of the show places of the Eastern Shore refused to accept this
belief. It is she whom the compiler of these chronicles is indebted for
the following proof.<BR> 

<DD>The tax list of 1783, original on file at the Maryland Historical
Society, shows that John T. Smoot was seated on 908 acres of "Rehoboth"
with 1 frame dwelling house, 1 kitchen, 1 granery, 1 saw mill, 1 store
house, 14 log slave houses, all located on the Nanticoke. He was further
seized of "Robson's Ridge" of 50 acres, with 1 frame dwelling house and
3 log houses, all situated inland; "Hill's Adventure" of 50 acres with 1
frame dwelling and 1 log house, also inland; and "Conclusion" of 360
acres with 1 log house, also inland. His total landed estate in
Dorchester County consisted of 1,687 acres, and he was the master of 42
slaves.</DD><BR>

<DD>Edward Smoot was seized of 523 acres of "Rehoboth", and 3 acres of
"Fisher's Lott", both tracts being inland, with 1 dwelling house and 12
log slave quarters. The only other owner of a portion of "Rehoboth" was
John Anderton, the husband of Amelia Lee, who was seized of 400 acres
with 2 small log houses on the Nanticoke, but his seat was at "Sandy
Hill". His landed estate, as has been previously stated, ultimately
reverted to the two children of John T. Smoot by his first wife.</DD?<BR> 

<DD>When John T. Smoot negotiated his will in 1787, he bequeathed the brick
dwelling on his plantation to his son John, therefore, it is an undisputed fact that 
"Liberty Hall" was erected by him sometime between the years 1783 and 
1787.<BR><BR>

<DD>Edward Smoot, son of Edward, was born 1748 at "Wicomico Fields", Charles

<DD>William Groves Smoot, son of Edward, was born about 1755 at "Wicomico

referred to him in his will in 1760. The wife of William Groves Smoot
has not been established nor the names of all his children. The census

daughters. Two children have been proved, while a third is inferred.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>From the meager facts we have on the personal life of William Groves
Smoot, it is concluded that he was indulgent and for that reason his
father failed to will him a share of the landed estate, but left it in
fee to his grandson, Thomas. At the March session of the court in 1778,
William Groves Smoot was arraigned and accused of bartering provisions
for rum and sugar on board of the enemy's ship. It is the opinion that
his action was due more for the thirst of alcohol, as no gold was
exchanged, rather than for any sympathy with the British.</DD><BR>
<DD>He was bondsman for John Tompkins Jr., when he closed the estate of Mary
Brandt.</DD><BR> 
<DD>William Groves Smoot died intestate as well as insolvent sometime
shortly after 1800. In the latter year Stephen Lynch, one of the
creditors, compelled the court to issue citations against Thomas Smoot,
late of Virginia, the son of William Groves Smoot, to ascertain why he
failed to request letters of administration for the settlement of his
father's estate. The administration was subsequently granted to Stephen
Lynch who acquired all assets.</DD>

<DD>In 1783 Henry Smoot was seized of 12 acres of "Gore", 72 acres of
"Hatch", and 70 acres of "Hatton's Improvement", all lying in Charles
County.</DD><BR> 

<DD>His father deeded him 500 acres of "Rehoboth" in Dorchester County,
where he established his domicile. He was drowned on February 13, 1820,
while crossing the frozen Nanticoke River at Crotchers Ferry. Some say
that it was in the attempt to rescue some horses which had wandered upon
the ice, others claim it occurred while he was trying to win a bet.</DD><BR>

<DD>On March 31, 1821, Thomas Smoot and Alexander Smoot were commissioned to
divide the land of their deceased father. The estate was partitioned
into eight parts and distributed to the following--Thomas Smoot;
Alexander Smoot; David Kennedy in right of his wife Mary; Elizabeth,
Mary, and Joseph heirs of Edward Smoot, deceased; Daniel Robertson
(Robinson) in right of his wife Janette; John Smoot; Joseph Smoot; and
Elizabeth Smoot.</DD><BR> 

<DD>His widow returned to Charles County, where her will was proved on
January 12, 1824. She bequeathed her daughter Elizabeth Brawner
personalty and wished to confirm the bill of sale to her husband Basil
Brawner. She devised her sons Joseph and Thomas, and daughter Jane
Robinson certain personal property in Dorchester County.</DD><BR> 

<DD>Thomas Smoot, her son, on October 25, 1826, petitioned the court of
Dorchester County for a division of the estate, showing that the widow
of Henry Smoot at her decease left a dower in realty. The heirs were
Mary Kennedy the wife of Daniel, John Warren Smoot, Alexander Smoot who
conveyed his rights to Thomas Smoot, Joseph Smoot who assigned to Daniel
Caulk, Elizabeth wife of Basil Brawner, and Jennet the wife of Daniel
Robinson.</DD><BR>

Maryland, for $85.50 their rights and title to one-fifth of the land
called "Rehoboth" containing 80 acres which the said Thomas H. R. Fowke
and Lydia Anne his wife inherited by the death of Mary Kennedy, the

Mary Parish, Charles County. On September 8, 1800, he conveyed to
Stephen Lynch, of St. Mary's County, land that had been willed him by
his father. In 1802 he sold additional realty to James Doyle, of Charles
County. At no time did his wife waive her dower rights.<BR> 

<DD>Facts tend to indicate, however, that he married twice, his first
marriage occurring in Charles County shortly after 1790, but a thorough
search of the records has failed to disclose any conclusive proof of a
first union. The census of 1790 establishes him as a bachelor but at the
next census of 1800 he had in his household a female born between the
years 1755 and 1774, the period in which he was born, and also three
males less than ten years of age. These small boys could not possibly be
orphaned nephews, and therefore it leaves much to be assumed.</DD><BR> 

<DD>There was an Alexander Smoot who was drafted from Maryland for service
in the War of 1812 and who was discharged during 1814 in Anne Arundel
County, Maryland, "60 miles from Home". This Alexander Smoot has not
been placed among the other Smoots, and it is believed that Alexander
Stoddert Smoot at this period was beyond the age for compulsory military
service, yet a man born between 1790 and 1800 would be of age for
combat.</DD><BR> 

<DD>If the fact of an early marriage is in doubt, it is known, however, that
Alexander Stoddert Smoot married Elizabeth, the daughter of Le Roy
Hipkins, of Caroline County, Virginia, and his wife Sally Reynolds, of
Essex County, Virginia.</DD><BR><BR>

District of Columbia was July 6, 1814, when he sold a number of slaves
to Ezekiel McDaniel.<BR> 

<DD>A letter addressed to him by P. A. L. Contee, dated September 27, 1813,
at Pickawaxon, Maryland, authorized him to sell a negress and her child,
and at the same time Mr. Contee presented his compliments to Mrs. Smoot
and "as you pass to Richmond I hope you will be mind full of your
promise to call and pass some time with us at the Glebe".</DD><BR> 

<DD>Alexander Stoddert Smoot died during 1815, apparently in Washington,
inasmuch as his interment was in old Holmead Cemetery of that city. His
widow remained in the national capital for some time after his death, as
is evident from the following certification recorded among the deeds of
the District. "I hereby certify that my mother Sarah Hipkins of Port
Royal, Virginia, has removed from that place to the County of
Washington, D. C., a negro girl about 15 years of age and has placed the
girl in my possession". Signed Elizabeth Smoot, dated May 1, 1821.</DD><BR> 

<DD>Her daughters, however, settled in Mobile, Alabama, where they became
leaders of the social life of that city. The census of 1860 shows that
the husband of Mrs. Moses Waring owned realty assessed at $200,000 and
personalty at $30,000.</DD><BR>

<DD>A letter of Mrs. Sallie Hipkins, dated Port Royal, April 21, 1830, to

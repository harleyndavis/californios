AND<BR>
HIS DESCENDANTS<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>Charles Smoot, son of Thomas and Elizabeth (Barton) Smoot, was born 
in the year 1700 at the parental homestead on the Wicomico. He was 
orphaned when he was not more than five years of age and, according to 
the will of his father, he was placed under the guardianship of his 
maternal uncle, Colonel William Barton, of Prince Georges County. 
Colonel Barton died within the same year as that of Thomas Smoot, and 
by a codicil to his will he mentioned the land left Charles by his father 
Thomas.</DD><BR> 
<DD>Charles Smoot married thrice, his first wife being Elizabeth, the daughter 
of Thomas and Martha (Sansbury) Harris.</DD><BR><BR>

appointed administrator by the court is proof that she had a life interest in 
the property. The inventory papers were filed on September 16, 1767, 
with an appraisement of &#0163;452/8/4, with William Courts and James 
Maddox as the sureties. Distribution was made on October 11, 1768, to 
the following representatives, no relationship stated--Ignatius Middleton, 
William Stone, Charles Sewell, Frances Goodrick, and the heirs of 
Edward Goodrick deceased. It is assumed that they were her step-
children or their husbands who claimed their father's estate upon the 
death of his widow.<BR> 
<DD>Charles Smoot took for a third wife his cousin Elizabeth, the daughter of 
William and Rachel Barton, but successively the widow of Henry 
Brawner and Aaron Nalley. She had married her first husband on January 
2, 1726/7, in Rock Creek Parish, of Prince Georges County. He died 
prior to 1749, leaving six children. The following have been proved--
William, Barton, and Henry. By her second husband she became the 
mother of four sons--John, Aaron, Richard, and Nathan Barton. To the 
latter chidren she deeded on March 26, 1767, her personal estate but 
reserved it to her use during life and that of Charles Smoot "providing 
that the said Charles Smoot should marry me in six months". Two days 
later she deeded "Wentworth Woodhouse" to her three Brawner sons 
"providing if Charles Smoot should marry me honourably in six months". 
At this date most assuredly a courtship was in progress.</DD><BR> 
The will of Charles Smoot was dated November 25, 1776, and proved in 
Charles County on March 20, 1778. He divided his estate among his wife 
Elizabeth and four children--Mary, John Nathan, Hendley, and William 
Barton. The inventory of the personal effects was taken on June 27, 
1778, with William Barton Smoot as the acting executor, and John N. 
Smoot and Hendley Smoot, signing as the kinsmen.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>The tax list of 1783 shows him seized of "Strife" of 105 acres, "Betty's 
Delight" 100 acres, "Noe's Desert" 35 acres, and "George's Hope", 76

official census of 1790. Through his wife he acquired an interest in 
"Morris Venture", originally patented by Richard Morris, which he with 
Richard Brandt and Margaret his wife conveyed to William Compton,

administration were issued to his eldest son Wilson, at which time 
Richard B. Brandt and William P. Ford offered bond. The inventory 
showed that his personal estate was appraised at $3,460. At a court

Wilson Smoot, Thomas Sellman, Smith Hawkins, Richard Brook Brandt, 
Jane Smoot, John Iglehart, Charles Smoot, and Hezekiah Smoot.</DD><BR>

the present hamlet of Newport in Trinity Parish where a number of the 
younger sons of the landed barons of the Wicomico settled when their 
patrimony did not entitle them to the ancestral seat. He engaged in the 
tanning trade, an occupation which proved the foundation for

<DD>Charles Smoot married prior to 1800, for the census for that year shows 
him the head of a family in Charles County, with a daughter less than ten 
years of age.</DD><BR> 
<DD>On October 12, 1815, Charles Smoot "Sr.", of Charles County, deeded 
land to William Henley Smoot, at which time his wife waived her third. 
Sometime after this date he with a number of other Maryland families 
migrated to Hickman County, Tennessee, and settled on the east side of 
Lick Creek just above the mouth of Fort Cooper Hollow. A nearby 
neighbor was David Killough, formerly of Pennsylvania, whose son 
married a daughter of Charles Smoot.</DD><BR> 
<DD>A history of Hickman County states that the Maryland settlers were of 
the highest types, many of them embracing the learned professions. 
Among the families enumerated were the Tyler, Weems, Semmes, 
Clagett, and Smith families. Charles Smoot was a doctor of medicine, 
while a member of the Semmes family was an attorney-at-law.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The first available census of Hickman County (1820) shows David 
Killough, Walter Tyler, and Horatio Clagett as neighbors of Dr. Smoot. 
The latter died before 1840, inasmuch as in that year his widow, Lettie 
Smoot, was the head of a family, with two maidens and a youth. She, 
however, was not a resident of the county in 1850. In that year Elizabeth 
Killough was the head of a family with realty assessed at $700, and with 
her were Mary Smoot, Agnes Smoot, and Walter Smith. Nearby lived 
Charles Smoot, a farmer, with realty valued at $300, and Sophia Smoot, 
born 1827 in Tennessee. It is not known whether Sophia was a wife or 
sister. No children, however, composed the household.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The destruction of all records by fire in Hickman County during 1865 
prevented any research in this county to ascertain further information on 
this family.</DD><BR><BR>

1812 he served first as a private in Captain John P. Parnham's Company, 
First Maryland Regiment, commanded by Colonel Hawkins. He was 
ordered into active service in July 1814, and was stationed in St. Mary's 
County. Later he was commissioned a lieutenant and served under 
Captain Dent.</DD><BR> 
<DD>On February 19, 1824, he married in Trinity Parish, by the Rev. Richard 
H. B. Mitchell, an Episcopal clergyman, Violetta Wilson, born April 18, 
1803, daughter of John Walter and Elizabeth Anne (Penn) Compton.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>In 1850 William Hendley Smoot was established on his estate, appraised 
at $6,000, in Allen's Fresh District, of Charles County. 
He died March 14, 1853. His will was dated March 12, 1853, and proved 
May 17, 1853, in Charles County, by Josiah H. Hawkins, Strouton W. 
Dent, and A. J. Smoot. He willed his entire estate to his unnamed 
children after the death of their mother.</DD><BR> 
<DD>In 1878, his widow Violetta W. Smoot applied for a Government pension 
by right of her husband's services in the War of 1812. Her marriage was 
certified by Jonathan T. Padgett, Joseph Lacey, Richard M. Smoot, and 
Anne M. Smoot. Strouton W. Dent stated that he had known Violetta 
Smoot for 55 years. She died, however, before the approval of her 
application. Letters of administration were issued on March 4, 1879, to 
Richard M. Smoot, of Charles County. Affidavits showed that in 1878 
Edward L. Smoot was a magistrate of Charles County.</DD>

James Richard Smoot offered his services to the South and was 
commissioned a major and assigned to the commissary department. He 
served throughout the conflict and at the end he bade farewell to his 
fellow officers in 1865 at Gordonsville, Virginia.<BR> 
<DD>While on furlough sometime in 1862 he was visiting his aunt, Carolina 
Brandt, formerly of Alexandria but then residing on a plantation in 
Culpeper County. At that time he met Anna, the daughter of William 
Crittenden, a neighboring planter, formerly of Kentucky, who had 
married Catherine Hudson and settled in Culpeper, the family home of 
his wife. They were married on May 27, 1863, the license having been 
obtained five days previously at Culpeper Courthouse.</DD><BR> 
<DD>His business in Alexandria ruined and his private fortune lost at the end 
of the war, he was practically penniless when he laid away his gray 
uniform. A brother officer of the Confederate Army had forty dollars in 
gold, and with a generous spirit he offered him half of his worldly goods. 
So with twenty dollars James Richard and his wife and baby boy settled 
in Culpeper County, where the former soldier began to rehabilitate 
himself. After an adventurous life Major Smoot died at his seat in 
Culpeper County, during May 1907 at the age of 89 years. He was 
survived by his three children, a son and twin daughters having died in 
infancy.</DD><BR><BR>

ALEXANDER SMOOT<SUP>5</SUP><BR>
AND<BR>
HIS DESCENDANTS<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<DD>Alexander Smoot, son of John, was born August 1, 1769, in St. Mary's 
County, Maryland, where he was domiciled as the head of his household 
at the 1790 census, unmarried, with two slaves. Shortly after that year he 
migrated to Culpeper County, Virginia, then a county containing much 
unpatented land, and joined some of his brothers and nephews who had 
already settled there. On October 17, 1798, at the county seat he secured 
license to marry Anne (Jones) Hawkins, a widow with young children. </DD><BR><BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<DD>Alexander Smoot with his young family including his step-children 
migrated about 1806 to Rowan County, North Carolina, and established 
his seat on land which had formerly been owned by the parents of Daniel 
Boone. On January 12, 1807, he purchased from Frederick Thompson for 
&#0163;400 land on Bear Creek, being a portion of a tract granted to a "certain 
Esquire Boon by the Lord Earl Granville". The conveyance was 
witnessed by William Nelson and William Smoot. On August 22, 1818, 
he instituted action against Thomas Ray for the erection of a mill on Bear 
Creek which flooded portions of his estate or as he stated in the petition 
"drowned my land".</DD><BR> 
<DD>The will of Alexander Smoot was dated November 26, 1816, and proved 
at the February court of 1826 in Rowan County, North Carolina, by 
Littleberry R. Rose and William Nelson. He bequeathed his step-
daughter Sally Allen $50 which was her "full share" of her father's estate, 
likewise he bequeathed similar amounts to the other step-children--Polly, 
wife of Brice W. Ijams;<SUP>1</SUP> John Hawkins; and William Hawkins.</DD><BR> 
<DD>He devised his widow Nancy 200 acres of land, negroes, and all other 
personal property during life which at her death were to be divided 
between his two sons--Thomas and Alexander. Both sons received direct 
200 acres of land between them. He willed his daughter Elizabeth</DD><BR>

be divided among his three children.<BR>

</CENTER>
<DD>Thomas Smoot, son of Alexander and Anne (Jones) Smoot, was born 
August 31, 1799, in Culpeper County, Virginia. He migrated to North 
Carolina with his parents and there he married a daughter of Jacob 
Holman, of Rowan County. According to family tradition two children 
were born--Mary and John.</DD><BR> 
<DD>On May 8, 1837, Thomas Smoot bought land lying on Dutchman's Creek 
in Davie County from William Hawkins. On March 28, 1843, he sold to 
Isaac Holman this land on Dutchman's Creek on which stood a saw and 
grist mill, his interest "being one-half subject to the dower of Catherine 
Linn, widow of John Linn". The deed was proved by Burgess Gaither 
and C. Hardin.</DD><BR>
<DD>On August 28, 1855, John A. Smoot, his son, conveyed to Isaac Holman 
for $50 "one-sixteenth portion of his grandfather's Jacob Holman 
undivided land". The deed was witnessed by Asberry Gaither. It is said 
that he is buried at Olive Branch Farm, near Farmington, North Carolina.</DD><BR>

Neely and his family landed about 1760, supposedly at Philadelphia,

on Hunting Creek, where he ultimately constructed a substantial log 
house on the south bank about three miles above its confluence with the 
South Yadkin River and about one mile, as the crow flies, from the 
present day Byerly's Chapel and graveyard. Today may be seen a large 
pile of rough stones which once formed the chimney and foundation, and 
nearby still flows a rock-bottomed spring which no doubt furnished 
drinking water to the plantation.<BR> 
<DD>Of several children born to Richard Neely and Mary Elizabeth his wife, 
Francis was probably their eldest child who distinguished himself during 
the Revolutionary War. As a youth he served in the Continental Army in 
the capacity of wagoner, especially in comradeship with his friend -------  
Guffy in collecting horses for the Army.</DD><BR> 
<DD>In 1781 following the American victory at Cowpens, Generals Greene 
and Morgan considered it inexpedient to meet Lord Cornwallis so 
consequently they marched northward with the British in hot pursuit. On 
reaching the Yadkin River at Trading Ford, several miles below the 
present town of Spencer, Greene and Morgan rushed across the Yadkin 
after which the river on account of recent rains rose to such a height that 
it became impossible for the British Army to ford it. A small detachment 
of the Continental forces, however, was left behind on the south bank of 
the Yadkin to guard some wagons and stores. Around midnight the 
advance guard of the British Army under General O'Hara and Colonel 
Tarleton reached the Yadkin and located the small American force, but 
believing it to be the main Continental Army, the British quickly retired 
to Salisbury where they encamped for a few days. In the meanwhile the 
Americans in some manner crossed the swollen river, and found 
themselves at the plantation of Richard Neely, cold, wet, and hungry. 
Here they were furnished a wagon filled with supplies of foodstuffs, 
home-woven jeans, and according to family tradition hometailored pants.</DD><BR> 
<DD>Ultimately when the advance guard of the British Army reached 
Renshaw's Ford, they found Francis Neely, a youth of twenty years, and 
his comrade Guffy with a drove of seventeen horses which they had 
collected for the Continental forces. The British fired upon them and 
mortally wounded Guffy, but Neely escaped unharmed, and knowing the 
country he escaped into canebrakes and the river jungles and hid until 
darkness. That night he swam the Yadkin and reached his home on 
Hunting Creek in safety.</DD><BR> 
<DD>For the patriotic services of Francis Neely during the Revolution, he was 
awarded by various accounts currency in the excess of &#0163;150.<SUP>3</SUP></DD><BR>

He later served as a magistrate of the District Court of Rowan County, 
and was active in this capacity during the War of 1812. He died in North 
Carolina, and was buried at what was formerly called the Van Eaton 
graveyard, now known as Byerly's Chapel.<BR><BR> 
<DD>By his will dated November 10, 1828, he bequeathed to his daughter, 
Temperance Smoot, "Harden Orton" and "Beard's Place", containing 600 
acres on the north side of the South Yadkin River adjacent to the lands of 
Samuel Thomas. </DD><BR><BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>In his early life Alexander Smoot was by profession a cabinet maker, 
which it is believed was taught him by his father. Some of his handicraft 
is still in the possession of his descendants, which show that he was not 
only a cabinet maker but a wood carver as well--especially the delicately 
carved hair on lion's feet supporting the superimposed pieces of his 
workmanship. Later he devoted his life to that of a merchant and planter 
at a place still remembered as County Line located on the line separating 
what was then Rowan (now Davie) County from Iredell. </DD><BR> 
<DD>Shortly after his marriage Alexander Smoot constructed on the land 
which he had inherited from his father-in-law on the north side of the 
South Yadkin River, a spacious and quaint log house about three miles 
from County Line. This house was originally built for the temporary use 
of him and his family until he was able to erect a large, manorial-like 
brick dwelling like his forefathers had built in old Maryland. The then 
log house was to be used as a dormitory for the slaves, but an early death 
prevented this vision from materialization.</DD>

<DD>At one end of the log house was a tall chimney of brick, and in front was 
a large front porch with stone steps, capped with halves of discarded 
circular stones which had been used formerly to crush fruits in making 
brandy. Nearby was the smoke house, granary, and apple house. The 
grounds were noted for the old towering elms, while at the foot of the 
hill, surrounded by giant oaks, was the spring-house. In the northwest 
corner of the garden grew the largest apple tree known to the countryside 
which had sprung from a seed planted by Temperance from some fall or 
winter apples which Alexander had brought home. Instead of bearing fall 
apples, as expected, it was a profuse bearer of midsummer fruit of the so-
called sheep-nose variety. </DD><BR> 
<DD>With the aid of a large number of slaves, Alexander Smoot bridged the 
South Yadkin and cultivated his extensive plantation which lay on both 
sides of the river. He fenced his broad fields with many thousands of oak 
rails, built into zig-zag style ten rails high, and above which was added 
an eleventh rail placed into the crotches of the stakes crossed like the 
letter X, and which was called the rider rail to prevent jumping stock 
from disregarding the barriers between green pastures and fields of grain. </DD><BR> 
<DD>In May 1829, Alexander Smoot purchased 200 acres of land from 
Caswell Harbin and his wife. On August 14, 1830, he and his wife 
Temperance conveyed to Arthur Neely 36 acres of land, being their share 
of the landed estate of Nathan Neely, deceased. During the same month 
he was named by the court guardian to Columbus Price, the son of 
William. In February 1831, he sold land on Third Creek to Robert N. 
Fleming, and in May of the same year, when he made another 
conveyance he declared in court that his wife was "not capable of coming 
to court." </DD><BR> 
<DD>On January 21, 1834, he deeded land to the trustees of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church for the erection of a "house of worship", receiving one 
dollar in hand to consummate the transaction. Upon the land was built a 
spacious edifice of large hewn logs, weather-boarded outside and 
finished inside. From the three doors on three sides of the building led 
aisles that crossed in front of an old-time high-box pulpit. From the 
ground floor led two stairways to a gallery for the slaves who always 
accompanied their masters and mistresses to services. The old edifice can 
now be considered a memorial to Alexander Smoot, where a monument 
has been erected to his memory, on which are chiseled the names of the 
first Board of Trustees. </DD><BR>

Illinois in the covered wagon of that day, and returned with a heavy</DD>

daughter Mary Henley the home plantation on which she was living, on 
the north side of the South Yadkin River, adjoining the land of John 
Turner and W. S. Smoot, the tract containing 244 acres. To her daughter 
Rebecca Dayvault she devised land on the south side of the Yadkin River 
in Rowan County, consisting of 150 acres, adjacent to J. F. Smoot and 
others. She mentioned her sons James F. and W. S. Smoot. Bequests 
were also made to the heirs of her sons A. N. Smoot and Nathan Smoot, 
and to the following grandchildren---Mary Micenhammer, Laura R. 
Shoaf, Alexander S. Turner, and Joseph F. Turner. </DD><BR><BR>

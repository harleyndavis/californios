CUTHBERT SMOOT<SUP>5</SUP><BR>
AND<BR>
HIS DESCENDANTS<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>Cuthbert Smoot, son of John and Sarah Smoot, was born about 1744 in 
St. Mary's County, Maryland. In 1778 he took the Oath of Fidelity and 
Allegiance to the State of Maryland, and in 1780 he was enrolled as a 
private in the militia of St. Mary's County.1 Other than these facts, very 
little is known of his public or private life. He predeceased his father, and 
owing to the destruction of records in St. Mary's County, no 
administration accounts on his estate are available. No marriage has been 
proved, but through the process of elimination it is believed and assumed 
that the five children named in the will of their Smoot grandfather--
Auny, Susannah, Eleanor, James (q.v.) and Barton--are his issues.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The presence of the name Barton among his children has sometime led to 
the supposition that this branch of the family was directly descended 
from Elizabeth Barton who married Captain Thomas Smoot. Barton was 
a favorite and popular name among the families of Southern Maryland 
and was carried by Barton lines other than that of the Smoot. It is 
therefore probable that the name came through the wife of Cuthbert 
Smoot whose identity has not been established.</DD><BR><BR>

James Smoot<SUP>6</SUP><BR>
(176- -1837)<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>James Smoot, believed son of Cuthbert Smoot, was born in St. Mary's 
County, Maryland. He followed his kinsmen to Culpeper County, 
Virginia, and there on December 18, 1797, he conveyed slaves, 
household furniture, and other personal property to Biscoe Smith, of 
Culpeper County. The witnesses were Philip Graves, Joseph Graves, and 
Henry Walker. The date of this conveyance approximates apparently the 
time of his migration to Rowan County, North Carolina.</DD><BR> 
<DD>On September 3, 1805, he purchased from Isaiah Renshaw and Esther his 
wife, of Rowan County, North Carolina, for the consideration of $750 
land on the south waters of Bear Creek in Rowan County which had been 
granted by the State to Abraham Renshaw. The conveyance was 
substantiated by Caleb Smoot and Samuel Austin.</DD><BR>

<DD>He and Jemina his wife deeded 312 acres of land "on the west side of Elk 
Runn a little below William Walker's old saw mill" in Virginia for the 
sum of &#0163;641/5/9. The deed was recorded in Madison County on January 
19, 1807.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>In May 1814 he and Francis Neely, Esq. with others were appointed to 
"lay off one year's provision for the widow and family of James Hanna, 
deceased". In 1815 he was a member of the commission to partition the 
land of Joseph Cope. On November 1, 1836, as a resident of Davie 
County, he sold land in Rowan County on the forks of the Yadkin River 
to Henry R. Austin. The deed was witnessed by H. Austin and Gassaway 
Gaither. During the same year he sold negroes to William Neely. 
The will of James Smoot was dated October 8, 1836, and proved in 
Davie County, North Carolina, at the August term of the court in 1837, 
with Gassaway Gaither as the executor. He named his son Thomas B. 
Smoot; daughters Mary Gaither, Margaret Anderson, Henrietta Lyons, 
and Brittania Sloan; granddaughter Elizabeth Gaither (daughter of 
Elizabeth), and the heirs of his daughter Elizabeth Gaither and the heirs 
of his daughter Eleanor Anderson.</DD><BR>

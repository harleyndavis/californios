WILLIAM SMOOT<SUP>5</SUP><BR>
AND<BR>
HIS DESCENDANTS<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<DD>William Smoot, son of John, was born about 1750 in St. Mary's County, 
Maryland. He married twice, and it seems as if both wives, certainly the 
second, were of Jenifer lineage. The name of his first wife is unknown, 
but at least two of her children bore the distinctive family cognomen of 
Jenifer. This first union probably occurred in St. Mary's County prior to 
1778. His second marriage, however, took place in Madison County, 
Virginia, where on June 24, 1793, license was obtained to marry 
Margaret Jenifer. In his will he referred to three of his sons with the 
given names of Jenifer, and it is noticed that in subsequent public records 
two other sons appeared with "J" as a middle initial.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>During the Revolutionary War William Smoot served his country, and in 
1780 he was enrolled as a member of the militia forces of St. Mary's 
County in the same battalion with his brothers Cuthbert, John, and 
Thomas.<SUP>1</SUP> In 1790 he was the head of a family in St. Mary's County, with 
5 males under the age of 16, 2 females, and 3 slaves. According to 
tradition, he lived at one time near Occoquan, Prince William County, 
Virginia, which was probably between the years 1790 and 1806, for by 
the latter year he was domiciled in Rowan County, North Carolina, with 
his family. On January 12, 1807, in the latter county he certified a deed 
of his half-brother.</DD><BR> 
<DD>He acquired much land in North Carolina, though the records fail to 
show any purchases or grants, and it is not believed that he was 
bequeathed any through last wills and testaments. 
At the census of 1810, he appears as the head of a family, with his three 
youngest sons at home and a feminine member of approximately</DD><BR>

<DD>The will of William Smoot was dated May 13, 1815, and proved at the 
August term of the court in Rowan County, North Carolina, by Samuel 
Little and Elisha J. Smoot. Jenifer was willed negroes and other 
personalty as well as the second son William. Daniel Jenifer was 
bequeathed negroes and land on Third Creek adjoining the estate of 
Solomon Dickson, containing 50 acres. John Jenifer was devised negroes 
and 160 acres of land adjoining that of John Reavis, also $40 to be paid 
him by his brother Eliphalet, $50 to be paid him by his brother Samuel 
within four years, and $30 to be paid him by his brother Elisha within 
three years. Elisha received negroes and 160 acres of land adjoining that 
of John Cooke and William Stillman. Samuel was bequeathed negroes 
and the dwelling-plantation and various personalty at majority. The 
residue of his estate was to be sold at auction and the proceeds divided 
among the five youngest sons. Daniel Jenifer and Elisha were named as 
executors. He signed his name as William Smoote Sr.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>Jenifer Smoot, son of William by his first wife, was born about 1778 in 
St. Mary's County, Maryland. On October 5, 1805, in Orange County, 
Virginia, he negotiated a bond to marry Rebecca, the daughter of John 
Melone, with Michael Lower as his surety and William McCome as the 
witness. He subsequently migrated to Rowan County, North Carolina, 
with his parents, where in 1810 he was the head of a family with his 
wife, two girls and a boy--the children all being under 10 years of age.</DD><BR>
<DD>On July 25, 1810, he purchased from Gilbert Nowell, of Rowan County, 
102 acres of land on the waters of Hunting and Bear Creeks. The 
transaction was witnessed by John Little Jr. On November 11, 1812, he 
conveyed this tract for $200 to William Fulford, at which time William 
Jarvis and John Boone witnessed the transfer.</DD><BR> 
<DD>He returned to Orange County, Virginia, perhaps the native country of 
his wife, and there on July 30, 1814, he enlisted for services in the War 
of 1812. His first term extended to November 30, 1814. On December 
11, following and to February 4, 1815, he served as a private in an 
artillery company commanded by Captain Law T. Dade, at which time he 
was stationed at Camp Holly, Virginia, attached to the First</DD>

Mary's County, Maryland. On February 11, 1808, in his native county he 
secured license to marry Elizabeth Parrott, the daughter of Thomas and 
Rebecca (Mackall) Loker, of St. Mary's County. He lived for a time in 
the county of his birth, where he was the head of his household at the 
1810 census.</DD><BR>

<DD>His youth was spent at his father's home in Virginia, according to 
tradition near Occoquan, but facts seem to place it in Madison County. 
At other times he lived in Rockbridge County, Virginia, "Kanrow City 
near Elk River", and in North Carolina. A letter addressed to him at 
Kanrow City in 1822 by his mother-in-law, still in possession of a 
descendant, asked, "What has become of the Jenifer Smoots and all of 
them?"</DD><BR> 
<DD>On July 18, 1816, after a residence of a few years in Rowan County, 
North Carolina, he conveyed to Baker Johnson land on the south fork of 
the Yadkin River where he "formerly lived", being part of a tract granted 
to Caleb Webb by patent in 1784. The consideration was $1,200. His 
wife Elizabeth P. Smoot relinquished her dower, and the deed was 
proved by E. A. J. Smoot and Richard Stroud.</DD><BR> 
<DD>On July 21, 1834, William Smoot, no domicile mentioned, gave his 
receipt to Thomas Loker, of St. Mary's County, the administrator of John 
Mackall Jr., for $150 which was his wife's share in the estate of the said 
John Mackall.</DD><BR> 
<DD>About 1835 he and a party of Virginians, including Carters, Atkinsons, 
Cooks, and others, migrated southward and after three weeks of travel 
they ultimately settled on the south bank of the Tennessee River at 
Tuscumbia, Alabama, where a number of his descendants are still living. 
It is traditional that enroute he visited his brother "Dr. Smoot" 
somewhere in Kentucky. He died at his home in Tuscumbia on March 
27, 1852; his widow survived until August 10, 1853.</DD><BR><BR>

Virginia, then migrated with his parent to Rowan County, North

marry Polly Anderson, with Garland Anderson and John March Sr. as his

and his wife 100 acres of land, at which time Charles Anderson Sr. 
witnessed the conveyance. On December 23, 1814, he sold to John 
Welch for &#0163;180 land on Hunting Creek, with John Lock and Eliphalet 
Smoot as witnesses. His wife Mary Smoot waived dower. On August 10, 
1820, he conveyed to Richard Anderson for $650 land on Andrew's 
Creek, consisting of 150 acres, beginning at a sycamore on Garland 
Anderson to an oak on William Iiams' line, then south to William Iiams' 
line. The deed was witnessed by Garland Anderson and Eliphalet Smoot. 
On August 22, 1823, he sold to John Smoot for $400 land of 200 acres 
on the bank of Hunting Creek. The transfer was witnessed by Charles 
Anderson Sr., and signed by Daniel J. Smoot and Polly Smoot.</DD><BR><BR> 
<DD>During 1825 Daniel J. Smoot and his young family left Rowan County 
and settled on the Pond Fork of the Little Coal River in Logan County, 
Virginia (now Boone County, West Virginia), bringing a number of 
slaves with them. There he found Price cousins, children of his aunt, 
Eleanor (Smoot) Price. It is traditional that the Price family was among 
the first settlers in that section of West Virginia.</DD><BR> 
<DD>On April 9, 1829, as a resident of Logan County, Virginia, he purchased 
from John Smoot of Rowan County, land on Hunting Creek containing 
200 acres. The conveyance was witnessed by James Glascock, Beal 
Iiams, and Jesse Oakes. Five days later he sold this tract to James 
Glascock and William Casey, of Rowan County, and to Abner F. 
Caldwell and John M. Young, of Iredell County, North Carolina.</DD><BR><BR> 
<DD>The census schedules for 1830 and 1840 show Daniel Jenifer Smoot to

North Carolina, he stated that his father and mother were born in 
Maryland. He accompanied his parents to Rowan County, North 
Carolina, and at the death of his father in 1815, a minor, he was 
bequeathed the dwelling-plantation which lay in the vicinity of Calahala 
post office.</DD><BR>
<DD>On February 3, 1820, he conveyed to Basil Dyson, of Rowan County, for 
the consideration of &#0163;25 land which had been deeded by Abraham

John Prather. It was then bought by William Smoot at a sheriff sale and 
willed to him by his father William Smoot. The tract was adjacent to the 
land of William Howard. The conveyance was certified by Garland 
Anderson, James Davis, and Charles Andrews. On January 10, 1822, he 
purchased from Jacob, John, and Robert H. Hughey 170 acres of land in

(1843 - 1918)<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<DD>Daniel Jenifer Smoot, son of William and Martha (de Jarrell) Smoot, was 
born 1843, in Boone County, Virginia. Although his section of Virginia 
had little sympathy with the Southern cause in 1861, Daniel Jenifer 
Smoot manifested the ideals of the old aristocracy of Maryland and 
Virginia, and as a lad of nineteen he enlisted in 1862 at Charleston in 
Company D, under Captain Lawson of the 36th Virginia Regiment, 
known as "Logan's Wild Cats", and attached most of the time to Early's 
Division.</DD><BR> 
<DD>He figured conspicuously in the campaigns up and down the Shenandoah 
Valley and was with General Jubal Early in Maryland when the 
Confederates had the Federal Capital in consternation. He participated in 
seventeen general battles and was at Camp Lee, Richmond, when 
General Lee surrendered. After his furlough from the Confederate Army, 
he returned home to find much of the former wealth of his parents lost. 
He was a Democrat in politics and held several district and county offices 
in addition to his occupation of farming.</DD><BR> 
<DD>About 1867 he married Mary A. Atkins, born about 1845, in Giles 
County, Virginia, whose parents were also natives of that State. He died 
in 1918; his widow died in 1928.</DD><BR><BR>

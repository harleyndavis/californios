ABRAHAM OWEN SMOOT<SUP>7</SUP><BR>
AND<BR>
HIS DESCENDANTS<BR><BR>
</CENTER>
<DD>Abraham Owen Smoot, son of George and Anne (Rowlett) Smoot, was 
born February 7, 1815, at "Pleasant Home" in what is now Owen County, 
Kentucky. His father died when he was less than six years of age. His 
mother in 1835 became a convert to the Mormon Church through the 
influence of missionaries who were then traveling in northern Kentucky. 
On March 22, 1835, he was baptized in the faith by Elder Warren 
Parrish. In the fall of 1836, he visited Kirkland, Ohio, and soon 
afterwards assisted in organizing and leading a group of converts from 
Kentucky to the community then at Far West, Missouri.</DD><BR> 
<DD>When the State militia and a mob of Westerners captured the settlement 
in Missouri, Abraham Smoot was made a prisoner. At this time, 
November 11, 1838, he married his first wife, Margaret Thompson 
(McMeans) Atkinson, born in South Carolina, the daughter of Anthony 
and Esther Hunter McMeans, of Chester County, South Carolina. Her 
father was a native of that State, while her mother was born in Scotland. 
By her first husband William Cochrane Atkinson, she had one son, 
William Cochrane Atkinson (q.v.), who took the name of Smoot upon his 
adoption by his step-father. No children were born to this first union.</DD><BR> 
<DD>On January 9, 1846, Abraham Owen Smoot married his second and third 
wives--Sarah Gibbens, born October 20, 1800, in Cumberland County, 
Kentucky, and Emily Hill, born November 25, 1816, in Pendelton 
District, of South Carolina, the daughter of John and Martha (Carlin) 
Hill, then the widow of Zachariah Harris.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>He served as a missionary to Great Britain in 1890 and 1891, and as 
counselor to President Edward Partridge of the Utah Stake from 1895 to 
1900. On April 8, of the latter year he was ordained an Apostle of the 
Church by President Lorenzo Snow.</DD><BR> 
<DD>On January 20, 1903, Reed Smoot was elected to the United States 
Senate by the Legislature of Utah. Formal protests were signed by a 
group of citizens of Salt Lake City, demanding his expulsion from the 
Senate on the grounds that he was a Mormon Apostle and a believer in 
polygamy. The case soon assumed national attention. Thousands of 
petitions and protests signed by religious organizations and women's 
associations poured in from all parts of the United States. From January 
16, 1904, to June 11, 1906, his case was before the Senate Committee on 
Privileges and Elections, which then reported 7 to 5 adversely to Senator 
Smoot. From December 13, 1906, to February 20, 1907, the case was 
before the Senate and the final vote rejected the resolution and permitted 
Senator Smoot to retain his seat in the Senate.</DD><BR>
<DD>During the long period he sat in the Senate, from 1903 to 1933, he served 
on some of the most important committees, and was finally Chairman of 
the Ways and Means Committee. Since 1933 he has devoted his time to 
his public ministry as an apostle and to problems of administration in the 
leading councils of the Church. In private life he has many business, 
financial, and mining interests.</DD><BR>
<DD>His wife died on November 6, 1928, at Washington, D. C., and on July 2, 
1930, at Salt Lake City, he married Alice, born October 29, 1876, at 
Westvale, Yorkshire, England, the daughter of James and Martha (Hurst) 
Taylor, but more recently the widow of Edwin Spencer Sheets.</DD><BR><BR>

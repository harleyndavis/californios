Henry Hawkins in his will, proved January 12,  1702/3, named his wife Sarah, and the following children--Alexander,  Tubman, Elizabeth, and Eleanor. On March 11, 1712, Barton Smoot and  Sarah his wife deeded to the latter's son Henry Hawkins, a tract of land in  Charles County.

 <DD>The membership of Lieutenant Smoot in the Society of the Cincinnati is  now represented, through his sister Sarah Anne (Smoot) Dodson, by his  great-great-great-great nephew, Judge William Breckenridge Ardery, of  Paris, Kentucky, and the grandson of Sarah Isabella Dodson by her  marriage in 1854 to Robert Ferris Adair. </DD><BR>  <DD>On February 24, 1827, his niece, Elizabeth (Smoot) Radcliffe, of Prince  William County, Virginia, applied to the Land Office for bounty land in  right as one of his heirs.

At the Charles County tax list of  1783, he was seized of 200 acres of "Green's Rest", 50 acres of  "Boarman's Friend's Offer", and 41 3/4 acres of "Toombit". He, however,  became a resident of St. Mary's County, where in 1792 he was elected a  vestryman of All Faith's Parish. On July 3, 1799, he sold to James Keech  a portion of "Hulsome", portion of "Truman's Hunting Quarter", portion  of "Truman's Lodge", and portions of the following tracts--"John  Edward's Discovery", "Price Lot", and "Plains of Jericho"--all lying in St.  Mary's County. </DD><BR>  <DD>In 1800 he had in his household 2 males between the ages of 10 and 16, 3  males between 16 and 26, 1 female between 16 and 26, and 1 female  between 26 and 45. In 1810 he was the head of a family with a female  over 45 years. </DD><BR>
<DD>On February 17, 1797, he patented "Little Yielding" of 19 1/2 acres,  lying in St. Mary's County, which he conveyed within a few weeks to  Jesse Lock. 
</DD><BR>
<DD>He died intestate in St. Mary's County. An inventory of his personal  effects was taken on February 8, 1821, 
appraised at $143.25, with  Richard D. Edwards as the administrator. The public sale of his goods  brought 
$188.28 3/4. No Smoots were among the purchasers. The  accounts showed $37.50 due as rent to Mary Chappelear. 
The fact that  his personal estate at his death was negligible, and that he was a tenant  leads one to the 
belief that he sustained financial reverses and for that  reason he was forced to dispose of his realty in 
1799. </DD><BR>   </FONT> <BR> <BR> </BLOCKQUOTE> </TD> </TR> </TABLE><BR><BR>

From this tradition we identify him as the William Smoot  who was seated on Little Battle Run in St. Mark's Parish, Culpeper  County, shortly after 1790. If such be the case, he buried his first wife  and married secondly Susannah Haydon or Hadden, of Maryland lineage.  The marriage was performed, according to the records of St. Mark's, on  December 4, 1795. Although she stated in 1850 that she was born in  Virginia, circumstances would seem to indicate that she was a native of  St. Mary's County, Maryland. In 1805 William Smoot and Susannah his  wife "as heirs of James Haydon, of Richard, late of Chaptico Hundred,  St. Mary's County, deceased" conveyed property to Peregrine Haydon.

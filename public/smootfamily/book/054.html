 <DD>In 1688 Thomas Smoot patented "Smoot's Chance" of 160 acres. On  August 11, 1690, Thomas Smoot, Carpenter, deeded to John Wilder for  8,000 pounds of tobacco "Cabbin Land" adjoining "Smoot's Discovery"  and the land adjacent to Richard Harrison lying on Smoot's Creek and the  Wicomico River.</DD><BR>  <DD>In 1696 Thomas Smoot was listed as a military and civil officer of  Charles County.<SUP>1</SUP> Subsequent records refer to him as captain. On May 4,  1703, he was commissioned High Sheriff of Charles County.  The will of Thomas Smoot was dated January 6, 1704, and proved in  Charles County on January 30, 1704/5 by Thomas Whichaley, Thomas  Careless, Samuel Durham, and James Sewell. He named his eldest son  Barton the executor with his brother-in-law Lieutenant-Colonel William  Barton, but in the event that Colonel Barton died during the minority of  his son, then Thomas Taney, Richard Harrison, Robert Yates, and  William Harbert were to administer on the estate.  Thomas and Charles received jointly 150 acres of "Robbin" and "Gwin's  Choice", 32 acres adjoining called "Cabbin", 21 acres of "Bargain", all  lying on the west side of the Wicomico River. On the condition that  Thomas and Charles died without issues, then the land was to revert to  William and John Nathan.

The four daughters--Elizabeth,  Rachel, Anne, and Mary--received personalty.  The inventory of his personal estate was filed in 1705, with Charles  Jones and William Martin as the appraisers. An account was rendered by  his executor Barton Smoot on November 22, 1706.  His eldest daughter Mary married John Bennett who on March 9, 1705,  conveyed to William Smoot and John Nathan Smoot for 3,000 pounds of  tobacco "Skipton" lying in Charles County. The deed read as follows  "Captain Thomas Smoot late of Charles County deceased in his lifetime  ... and said Thomas Smoot by last will did devise the parcel of land to  William and John Nathan Smoot". Both Mary and her husband made  their mark.<BR>   <DD>"Skipton" of 200 acres was surveyed July 22, 1672, for Robert Casseton,  adjoining the lands of John Cane and Garrett Sinnett. This tract later  became the seat of Barton Smoot whose widow was seized of the entire  tract at the rent roll of 1753. Inasmuch as John Nathan Smoot was willed  this tract jointly with his brother, and no deed is available to show the  conveyance to Barton Smoot, though several deed books are missing in  Charles County, it therefore can be established that Barton inherited or  purchased it from his brother, John Nathan, who apparently died without  issues. No further record of John Nathan is found beyond the year 1705.</DD>    </FONT> <BR><BR> <BR> </BLOCKQUOTE> </TD> </TR> </TABLE><BR><BR>   <TABLE ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="33%" CELLPADDING="5" BORDER="3" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> <TR> <TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH="50%"><CENTER> <FONT FACE="goudy old style, book antiqua, century schoolbook, times new roman, times"> <A HREF="050.html">Back</font></CENTER></TD> <TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH="50%"><CENTER> <FONT FACE="goudy old style, book antiqua, century schoolbook, times new roman, times"><A HREF="056.html">Next</A></FONT></CENTER></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH="50%"><CENTER> <FONT FACE="goudy old style, book antiqua, century schoolbook, times new roman, times"><A HREF="search.html">Search</A></FONT></CENTER></TD> <TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH="50%"><CENTER> <FONT FACE="goudy old style, book antiqua, century schoolbook, times new roman, times"> <A HREF="205.html">Index</a></FONT></CENTER></TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER> <BR><BR> <DIV ALIGN="justify"> "The Smoots of Maryland and Virginia" by Harry Wright Newman, originally  published privately in Washington D.C. in 1936.

<DD><I>Henry Smoot</I> was born about 1795. He served as private in the  detachment of Major King, 
D. C. Militia, and later as a corporal in the  company of Captain Richard Johns. It is believed 
that he was the Henry  Smoot who died intestate in Charles County, when his widow, Catherine  
Smoot, was named administratrix. The inventory of his estate was taken  on February 16, 1816. 
At the final account, showing no distribution, in  1820 his widow was Catherine Brawner.</DD><BR>

Chloe Smoot, Barton  Smoot, Samuel Smoot, Thomas Milstead, and William Smoot who  bought the 
wearing apparel. The final account, rendered by Chloe Smoot  on October 21, 1807, showed no 
distribution. </DD><BR>  <DD><I>Matthew Smoot</I>, of Charles County, a drafted militiaman,

<DD>The will of his widow Anne Smoot was dated March 4, 1854, and proved  in the District of 
Columbia on July 22, 1854, by P. McKenna, Martha  McKenna, and Oliver McConnell. She 
bequeathed to her son John  William Smoot land opposite Good Hope which her late husband  
"George Arthur Smoot" purchased from George Naylor. To her daughter,  Anne Virginia Smoot, 
she devised the house and lot on Pennsylvania  Avenue in square 790 and the house and lot on 
M Street between 10 and  11 Streets East in square 777. Various articles of personal property 
were  divided between her two Smoot children. Her son Joseph T. Mitchell was  willed $100, while 
the following were devised $1.00 each--Joseph T.  Mitchell, Frances Eugene Mitchell, James Thomas 
Broscuo, and Martha  Anne Anderson. She named her brother Thomas Jenkins as the executor. </DD><BR>

M. Bronaugh. She willed her  grandsons William and Charles the vacant lot on the west side of her  
dwelling house on the north side of Prospect Street in Georgetown. To  her granddaughter Mary Anna Smoot 
she devised the mansion house and  lot where she was living at the intersection of Prospect and Market  
Streets, but her daughter-in-law Mary B. Smoot was to enjoy the use of it  during life. She named her 
daughter-in-law the guardian of the  grandchildren, and Richard Plummer Jackson, the executor of the 
estate.</DD><BR>  <DD>Mary B. Smoot, the daughter-in-law, was born 1818 in Virginia, and  according to 
the 1860 census was possessed of realty appraised at $5,000  and personalty at $3,000. Her son, Charles 
C. Smoot, died unmarried,  willing his entire estate to his mother. The will was admitted to probate

<CENTER> CULPEPER COUNTY, VIRGINIA<BR><BR></CENTER>  <DD><I>Thomas M. Smoot</I>,

all born between 1810-1820. He owned 17  slaves. On August 23, 1820, he purchased land at 
<A HREF="http://www.usgennet.org/family/smoot/va/culpeper/18200823.html">Elkton, Culpeper 
 County</A>, formerly belonging to Beverley Carter for $4,694.21, sold by a  decree of the chancery court held at 
Fredericksburg. On August 18, 1821,  he sold the portion on which he was then living to James S. Emmons, of  
Culpeper County, and on December 3, 1823, another portion to Enoch  Jameson. On January 27, 1826, he purchased 
from John S. Thornton 40  acres of land at $14 per acre, adjoining the land of William C. Carter. </DD><BR>

</DD><BR>  <DD><I>Benjamin Smoot</I>, born before 1765, was the head of a family in Culpeper  County in 1810,

3 girls and 1  boy born 1800-1810. </DD><BR> <DD><I>Anne B. Smoot</I>, widow, was born in Virginia about the 
year 1789, but  research has failed to disclose the name of her husband. She was  probably married after 1810 
and being widowed before 1820, the census  records have been of very little service in drawing any possible  
conclusions. She first appears as the head of a family in 1820, with two  boys less than ten years of age, 
a girl between the ages of 16 and 26, and  13 slaves. In February 1833, she purchased from Reuben Thornton and  
Lydia his wife, all parties being of Culpeper County, for $150 land on the  road leading from Culpeper Court 
House to Raccon Ford, adjoining the  lands of John Collins, Reuben Rosson, and Benjamin Truman. This tract  
in 1836 she deeded to her son John. </DD><BR><BR>  <BLOCKQUOTE> Children of Anne B. Smoot<BR><BR> 1. James W.

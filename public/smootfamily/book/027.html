John Smoot<SUP>6</SUP><BR>
(1755 - 1845)<BR><BR></CENTER>
<DD>John Smoot, son of John Smoot by his first wife, was born May 11, 1755, in 
Charles County, Maryland, though his son in 1880 stated Virginia as the birthplace. Before majority he had left the parental roof and had settled in the western portions of 
Culpeper County, Virginia.</DD><BR>
<DD>In 1775 he enlisted in a company commanded by Captain Daniel Morgan who
was soon promoted to the rank of colonel, consequently Lieutenant John
Humphrey was raised to the captaincy. The company rendezvoused at
Winchester, and from that point marched to Cambridge, Massachusetts,
where it joined the forces of Benedict Arnold, under whom the outfits
made their way to Quebec, Canada. John Smoot, however, was taken ill
enroute and was sent to Cambridge with other incapacitated soldiers to
recuperate. After he regained his health, he marched to Roxbury,
Massachusetts, where he joined the company of Captain Hugh Stevenson. He
remained there until the Americans captured Boston, after which he with
his company marched to Staten Island. He was honorably discharged at the
conclusion of the year's enlistment.</DD><BR>

<DD>In Culpeper County, Virginia, during 1779, he enlisted in the company of
Captain Benjamin Roberts, with James Slaughter as the lieutenant.
Colonel George Slaughter and Colonel Clark commanded the regiment. His
outfit marched from Culpeper to the falls of the Ohio River, now
Louisville, arriving during October of 1779, and remaining until the
fall of 1780. At this time he hired a man to complete the remainder of
his term of six months, consequently he returned to Culpeper County.</DD><BR> 

<DD>In July 1781 he again volunteered and served under Captain Cadawalder
Slaughter, of Culpeper County, and was present at York Town during the
surrender of Cornwallis.</DD><BR>

<DD>At the cessation of hostilities, John Smoot returned to Culpeper County,
where he married, according to tradition, Elizabeth Grant, a native of
Virginia. A complete list of their children has not been determined.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>Prior to 1795 John Smoot migrated to Hardin County, Kentucky, and
established his seat on Round Stone Creek. In 1805 he was a taxpayer on
325 acres of land. The first available census for Kentucky (1810)
indicated that he had a large family.</DD><BR>
<DD>On September 20, 1832, at Elizabethtown, Kentucky, he applied for a
revolutionary pension. His services were certified by John Cole, of
Barron County, Kentucky, who served with him under Captain Morgan, and
by George M. Bedinger, of Carlisle County, Kentucky, who stated that he
had in his possession a receipt book containing about 80 signatures of
soldiers belonging to the company of Captain Stevenson. He furthermore
certified that he had not seen Smoot for 56 years, but the following
appeared in his book.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>Charles Smoot, son of John and Anne (Ford) Smoot, was born between the
years 1784 and 1794, in Charles County, Maryland. After 1800 he migrated
to Chesterfield District of South Carolina, where by the census of 1810
he was the head of a family with a young wife and daughter less than 10
years of age. Very little information has been obtained on his
descendants, but the sketches of the following South Carolinians are
believed to be his descendants.</DD><BR>

1863, he was confined to the hospital at Florence. At the Seige of
Petersburg on July 30, 1864, he was taken prisoner by the enemy and
carried North. He arrived at Point Lookout, Maryland, on August 5, 1864,
from whence he was transferred to Elmira, New York, on July 11, 1865.
His papers stated that his home was in Georgetown, Georgia (believed to
be South Carolina), and that his complexion was florid, hair dark, eyes
blue, and height 5 feet 9 inches. He was released by the Federal
Government during the latter part of 1865.</DD><BR><BR>

<DD>Charles Smoot, son of Thomas and Sarah (Alexander) Smoot, was born

Virginia. He married Elizabeth ----, who was probably a Widow Way at

<DD>In 1774 Charles Smoot was indebted to Rawleigh Alexander to the extent

Way, the orphans of Richard Way. Charles Smoot inherited the 100-acre
plantation of his maternal grandmother, Anne Alexander, upon the death
of his brother Thomas, when it was recorded in court that all the
daughters were deceased except Winifred Walker and that the "said"
Charles Smoot was the heir-at-law.</DD><BR> 

<DD>According to the State Enumerations for 1782 Charles Smoot was the head
of a family in St. Stephen's Parish with six whites and one negro slave.
Two years later the records show that he still had six whites in his
household and that the improved property on his plantation consisted of
one dwelling and four out buildings.</DD><BR>

<DD>His son William Smoot on June 9, 1801, sold the 100-acre plantation of
his deceased father to Edward Mitchell, of Fairfax County, Virginia. The
land was described as bordering the Wicomico River and adjoining the
lands of Rich Edwards, Lancelot Edwards, and Joseph Hudnalls. It is
assumed that William Smoot conveyed his holdings prior to his leaving
the county, inasmuch as the first available census for Virginia (1810)
shows no Smoots as heads of families in Northumberland County.</DD><BR>

                            (1792 - 1857)<BR><BR></CENTER>

<DD>Joseph Edward Smoot, son of John and Elizabeth (Parker) Smoot, was born
1792 in Dorchester County. From Maryland he was appointed a midshipman
in the United States Navy on December 1, 1809, and rose successively to
the rank of captain.</DD><BR> 
<DD>As midshipman he served on the <I>U. S. S. Hornet</I> with Captain James
Lawrence and participated in the engagement with the H. B. M. S. Peacock
and her capture on February 14, 1813. Other vessels on which he saw sea
service were <I>Nonsuch, Macedonian, Peacock, Grampus, Erie,</I> and <I>Levant,</I>
and had duty at the following Navy Yards--Norfolk, Washington, and
Portsmouth. His last command was at the latter station from 1852 to
October 1, 1855, from thence he retired to his residence on K Street in
the National Capital.</DD><BR> 

<DD>He was one of the three Marylanders who received by an act of the
Maryland Legislature a sword at the conclusion of the War of 1812 "for
the gallant and good conduct of Joseph Smoot a native of this State and
now a lieutenant in the Navy of the United States in the actions between
the <I>Hornet</I> and <I>Peacock</I> and <I>Hornet</I> and <I>Penguin"</I>. </DD><BR>
<DD>Resolution number one of the Acts of 1858 relates that the late Captain
Smoot felt himself aggrieved by the action of the Government of the
United States under the act entitled "an act to promote the efficiency
of the Navy" and that while suffering under what he conceived to be the
wrong and injustice done to him, he departed his life in sorrow and
sadness, and Mrs. Anne E. Smoot, his widow, feeling on her part that it
would not be proper to retain the sword, returned it to the State of
Maryland.</DD><BR> 
<DD>The Governor of Maryland presented the sword which had thus been
returned to the State to Algernon Sydney Smoot, son of the late Captain
Joseph Smoot, with the charge that he shall cherish it as a testimonial
of high appreciation of the State of Maryland for the distinguished
service of his late father and that it shall never be drawn from its
scabbard for use except in defence of his country, her rights, or her
sacred honor.</DD><BR>
<DD>Joseph Smoot married first Margaret ----, born 1813. She died January
15, 1838, and was interred in Congressional Cemetery, Washington, D. C.</DD><BR>

<DD>William Henry Smoot, son of Joseph and Julia Anne (Dement) Smoot, was

War he was in school at Blacksburg, Virginia, and at the early age of 16
years he, with his entire class at school, enlisted in the Confederate
Army. He served faithfully throughout the War between the States and was
furloughed near Richmond. He made his way to Washington mostly on foot
only to find his mother's residence infested with hordes of negro
refugees. He then traveled to his grandmother's home in Maryland. And as
he was coming up the path to the house, his mother who was on the porch
saw an unkempt, emaciated man with several weeks' growth of beard and
bare-footed. She became alarmed and started to return to the house when
he cried, "Mother, don't you know me?" Her first remark was "But where
are your boots?" "I ate them before I left Richmond." </DD><BR>
<DD>In 1869 he married Lavania, the daughter of Matthew and Hannah
(Harrison) O'Brien, of Avandale, Fairfax County, Virginia. The license
was issued in Fairfax County and stated that the prospective bride was
aged 22 and was born in Baltimore, Maryland. William Henry Smoot died

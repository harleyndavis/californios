&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>First</B> came 1585 English attempt to  establish the Roanoke 
settlement North Carolina territory. This settlement was abandoned; then came a second attempt in 
1586 which also soon failed.  <BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first permanent settlement in North Carolina territory was
 establish in 1653 when settlers from Virginia occupied a section north of Albemarle Sound.  
In 1655, the King&#0146;s charter for the Proprietorship of Carolina in effect gave Carolina the 
land that was to later become South and North Carolina and Tennessee. The Charter specified
 Carolina&#0146;s boundary as:  &#0147;. . . All that Province, Territory, or Tract of ground, situate, 
lying, and being within our Dominions of America aforesaid, extending North and Eastward as  
far as the North end of Carahtuke River or Gullet; upon a straight Westerly line to Wyonoake Creek, 
which lies within or about the degrees of thirty six and thirty Minutes [36&#0176; 30'], Northern 
latitude, and so West in a direct line as  far as the South Seas; and South and Westward as far as the degrees 
of twenty nine, inclusive, northern latitude; and so West in a direct line as far as the South Seas . . .&#0148;  
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 1691, the province was called North 
Carolina, but administered by South Carolina until 1711. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the Revolution, the Church of England 
was the established church in North Carolina. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the end of the Revolutionary War, the 
province of North Carolina became our twelfth state (1789).

Our surname project is registered at <a href="http://www.familytreedna.com/">Family 
Tree DNA</a>* .   Most of your questions concerning DNA testing for genealogical 
purposes can be answered at that site.  If not, contact us via <a href="mailto:steve@smoot.com">email</a>.</p>
<DD>Use <a href="http://www.familytreedna.com/surname_join.asp?code=S93469">this link</a> 
to join the project and purchase your DNA test.<BR><BR> 
<DD>You will be asked which test you want to take.  We recommend that you take the 25 or 
or the new 37 marker test because all the 12 marker test will tell you is whether two 
samples are the same or not, in other words, whether they have a common ancestor or not.  
The 25 or 37 marker test goes beyond that to tell us about how many generations it is back 
to the most recent common ancestor.  The more markers you test AND match, the greater the 
 specificity of the estimated number of generations back to the common ancestor.  
A 12/12 match means there is a 50% probability that a common ancestor is within 14 generations. 
A 25/25 means there is a 50% prob. of the common ancestor within 7 generations.   
 A 37/37 match moves the 50% probability to 4 and 1/2 generations.

<DD>
The 12 marker test costs $99 plus $2 postage; the 25 marker test costs $169 plus 
$2 postage. The new 37 marker test costs $229 plus $2 postage. Note: This is a reduced 
rate since it is a group. You can start with the 12 or 25 marker test and upgrade to 37 
markers at a later time.

We have no financial interest in this project nor do we have any association 
with Family Tree DNA Company beyond using them as our testing lab. 
We are only interested, like others in this group, in furthering our genealogical research.

Study</I></B></FONT>  <BR> <DIV ALIGN="justify">

Women (and men whose surname is not Smoot) cannot provide DNA for the study; however, 
there are many other ways they can help.
 Here are some things you can do: <BR><BR>
1. Find Eligible Smoot Males to join the Smoot DNA Study. If you can&#0146;t give DNA, 
perhaps you can find an eligible male relative 
who can test in your place. You may have to go back two or three generations to a 
grandfather or great-grandfather&#0146;s brother&#0146;s sons 
and trace the line down to present day. <BR><BR>
2. Help Research the DNA Family Lines. Each of the family lines has to 
be researched to find the connecting ancestors. Members 
of the donor&#0146;s family line can provide information and help in that research. <BR><BR>
3. Donate money to defray the costs to those who can&#0146;t afford to join. <BR><BR>
<dd><p>To help, or to donate money, email <a href="mailto:steve@smoot.com">Steve Smoot, Administrator</A>, <I><B>

Thomas DURHAM's 1711 will made reference, twice, to that 50 acre parcel, 
trying to ensure the property stayed within the family (by inheritance, 
it went to eldest son Thomas DURHAM, thence to second son John DURHAM 
and if all else failed, to eldest grandson Thomas Dodson, son of daughter 
Mary). Reading it through again, I can see why Glenn might think Mary 
Gilbert could be Thomas DURHAM's mother. In that case, naming his only 
daughter Mary, makes sense.

CH Notes: Mary, d/o Thomas Sr. and Dorothy, was born 5 Jun 1686, married 
before ?, Thomas DODSON, s/o Charles and Ann, b 15 May 1681. Thomas, Jr., 
s/o Thomas Sr. and Dorothy, was born 27 Jun 1690, married before 1708, 
Mary SMOOT, born 7 Apr 1693, d/o William and Jane SMOOT. According to 
Headley, "Dorothy DURHAM was probably related to William SMOOT, Sr. 
She married (2) Jeremiah GREENHAM, Feb 1714/15." (Marriages of 
Richmond Co, VA, p. 81). According to DNFP, Dorothy, wife of Thomas 
DURHAM, Sr., was the daughter of William and Jane SMOOT, Sr. "Two of 
Dorothy Smoot DURHAM's sisters were Alice SMOOT who married (1) John 
CHINN; (2) John STRECHLEY; Alice died in 1701 in Lancaster Co, VA 
(WB8:105-6). Her children named in the will were Ann FOX, wife of 
Capt. William FOX, Catherine HEAL and Rawleigh CHINN. The other 
sister was Thomazin SMOOT who married a MARSHALL." DNFP does not 
state their source for Dorothy's parents, but Lancaster records 
have not yet been examined.

DURHAM Paper, 1998 
by Michelle Ule, Robertule@aol.com, Ukiah, CA

Somehow a Thomas DURHAM got to Virginia, whether as a child or on his own, we
don't know.  He planted tobacco in Richmond County and owned land.  At some
point before 1686, he married a woman named Dorothy, whom many genealogists
believed was the daughter of William Smoot.  Contrary evidence, however, shows
Dorothy DURHAM and her two sisters Alice Chinn Stretchley and Thomasin
Marshall Goodridge were more likely the daughters of one Mary GILBERT, widow.

        The primary historical connection between William Smoot Sr. 
and Dorothy DURHAM is the granting of land in 1700.  On August 2, 
1700, William Smoot Sr.: for love and affection for Dorothy DURHAM, 
wife of Thomas DURHAM, and her children, deeded sixty-two acres of 
land entailing it upon their eldest son Thomas DURHAM Jr., their 
second son, John DURHAM and their eldest daughter, Mary DURHAM; 
he provides if all of these children the said land was to descend 
to the fourth, fifth and sixth child of the said Dorothy DURHAM 
and if all the aforementioned children of Dorothy DURHAM deceased, 
said land to descend to Ann Fox, wife of William Fox, Gentleman, 
of Lancaster County.

        The property was given to Dorothy DURHAM and her three 
children "for love and affection".  The land was "entailed" to the 
children: eldest son to second son to daughter.  According to the 
Oxford English Dictionary, entail means "to settle on a number of 
persons in succession so that it [an estate] cannot be bequeathed 
at pleasure by any one possessor".

        The Encyclopedia Britannica explained that in entailed 
property, the inheritance was "confined to the heirs of the 
body".  By entailing the gift property to Dorothy DURHAM and her 
children, Smoot appeared to be ensuring the property stayed 
specifically within her family.  Note the property was not
assigned to Thomas DURHAM Sr., at all.  This coupled with the 
notations about love and affection, seemed to indicate 
Dorothy was at least a relative, and many supposed she was his 
daughter.

        Ann Fox, to whom the land would revert if no DURHAMs survived, 
was Dorothy DURHAM's niece, the married daughter of her sister Ann 
Chinn Stretchley.  Ann Stretchley had other children who apparently 
were overlooked in this potential gift. It is not clear if Thomasin 
Marshall Goodridge had any children at the time of the deed.

        In the Smoot gift, Jane Smoot is listed as waiving her dower 
rights [Internet comment from Steve Smoot].  The Oxford English 
Dictionary defines dower as "1. the portion of a deceased husband's 
estate which the law allows to his widow for life. 2.  The money or 
property which the wife brings to the husband". 

        Customarily, when a woman waived her dower rights, 
she was agreeing not to expect the property to become hers when 
her husband died.  But what if, in this case, Jane was waiving 
rights to property she brought into the marriage which her husband 
was then assigning to members of Jane's natal family? Perhaps 
Dorothy DURHAM and her sisters were children of Jane's sister?  And
perhaps Jane's sister was Mary GILBERT?

        These questions are not answerable at present.  We do know, 
however, that Dorothy DURHAM's son Thomas DURHAM Jr. married 
William Smoot's daughter Mary about 1710.  Mary Smoot, however, 
would have been a seven year old child in 1700, so her future 
relationship with Dorothy DURHAM really isn't germane here.

        In 1707, William Smoot deeded Thomas and Dorothy DURHAM 
another fifty acres (Deed Book 4, page 109, 111). That same year, 
on April 26, Mary GILBERT deeded the DURHAMs 50 acres of land 
"adjoining William Smoot's" gift, according to Shirley Corbari 
in The Guio-Dodson Family.  The property was described in the 
deed book as being upon a branch of Farnham Creeke called and 
knowne by the name of the Buory Swamp, containing by 
estimation fifty acres, now in the tanure and occupation 
of William Wright.  The deed was signed, sealed and 
delivered in the presence of William Smoot and Mil. Walters.

        Miles Walters witnessed Thomas DURHAM's will eight years 
later, so perhaps he was a neighbor.  Mary GILBERT obviously was 
acquainted with William Smoot.

        William Smoot Sr. died in 1716; his will named his wife 
Jane, son-in-law Thomas DURHAM and three grandchildren: Margaret, 
Joseph and Sarah DURHAM (the only three DURHAM children born at 
the time of Smoot's death).  The fact his will made no mention 
of the sisters Dorothy, Alice and Thomasin (Dorothy and Thomasin 
were still alive) would indicate they probably were not his 
daughters.  Jane Smoot died in North Farnham Parish on 
October 4, 1726.

        Alice was born about 1665 and married John Chin 
(16??-1692)[Corbari] by whom she had three, possibly four 
children as named in her 1701 will: Ann Fox(1682-1729), 
Catherine Heal, Rawleigh and possibly Jno. Chin.  Her second 
husband was John Stretchley, Gentleman (ca 1649-1698).  

        Alice's August 29, 1701 will is confusing in regard 
to relationships and lists them as follows:
          daughters Ann Fox and Catherine Heal; sister Dorothy DURHAM; cousin
Mary Dodson; son-in-law Capt. William Fox; Ann Fox's father, Jno. Chin; Ann
Fox's father-in-law Jno. Stretchly; son Rawleigh Chin; sister Tomazin
Marshall". [Lancaster Co. VA Inventories and Wills 1690-1709, vol 8, p. 105]

        Dodson family historian Glenn Gohr pointed out seventeenth century people
sometimes defined relationships differently than we do in the present.  In
this case, Mary Dodson was Alice's niece, not her cousin.  This is interesting
in light of the reference to "Ann Fox's father, Jno. Chin", a man who is
believed to have died several years before and then been succeeded by John
Stretchly.  Stretchly is described as Ann's father-in-law in the will, but he
actually was her step-father.  Alice left something to Jno. Chin, so perhaps
he was her son, not her ex-husband.

        Thomasin Marshall Goodridge is believed to have been born about 
1667.  She is thought to have married Abraham Marshall, who owned land 
in Richmond County which eventually came into the possession of the DURHAMs.  
(And they sold it in 1723 to Thomas Dodson Sr.).  It is not clear when 
Marshall died, but at some point after 1701 Thomasin married William Goodridge.

        William Goodridge signed his will on May 12, 1713 and it contained the
following provisions:

          named Thomasin wife of William; to son William all land in Lanc. 
Co., which I bought of Richard Alderson and John (Buxton); other chil. 
Moses and Elizabeth; desires Mr. Rawleigh Chinn to have the care of the 
three chil. until age 21; ex: fr. Rawleigh Chinn; wits: none given, but 
prov. By the oaths of Dorothy and Thomas DURHAM (Sr.). [Wills of 
Richmond County, VA 1699-1800]

        Rawleigh Chinn was Alice Chinn Stretchley's son and thus 
a cousin to Goodridge's children (Interestingly, the Rawleigh name 
appeared for generations afterwards in the Dodson family).  The 
children, thus, probably were Thomasin's children as well.  The 
DURHAMs provided an oath certifying the will; they were Goodridge's 
sister-in-law and brother-in-law.  The familial relationship is 
further explained in a reference to "Aunt Dorothea" in Rawleigh's 
sister Ann Chinn Fox Chichester's 1725 will.  (The IGI lists 
Dorothy DURHAM's death as 1716, but the 1725 reference suggests 
she must have lived at least that long).

        This lengthy discussion of Dorothy DURHAM's sisters is 
to explain in part why she is not believed to be William Smoot's 
daughter.  Neither Dorothy nor her still-living sister Thomasin 
were mentioned in Smoot's 1715 will, though Dorothy's DURHAM 
grandchildren (the children of Smoot's daughter Mary Smoot 
DURHAM) were included.

        Mary GILBERT, described as a widow in an indenture she 
signed to Thomas and Dorothy DURHAM, is believed to be Dorothy 
DURHAM's mother instead.  The aforementioned indenture, signed 
April 26, 1707, gave fifty acres of land to Thomas and Dorothy 
DURHAM and their heirs. 

        Mary GILBERT probably was married to James GILBERT, 
though we do not know if he was the father of her daughters.  
Virginia Colonial Abstracts, Richmond
County, Records 1704-1724, compiled by Beverly Fleet, lists a 
series of depositions made about James GILBERT.  Among those 
testifying were Dorothy DURHAM (age 41 years in 1704) and 
William Smoot.  

        The depositions appear to be about James GILBERT's 
will which someone was contesting.  GILBERT is portrayed as an 
irreligious, hunting-loving man at odds with his wife and some 
of his neighbors.  He had told witness Ann Kelly "he had not the 
sense to make a will" and she saw James GILBERT "count 15 head of 
Cattle for fourty".  He apparently died of burns between New Year's 
Day and November of 1704.

        According to her deposition, Ann Kelly was a servant to Thomas "Dierham"
(DURHAM) and Mary GILBERT was staying with the DURHAM family on New Year's Day
1704.  DURHAM sent Kelly to fetch GILBERT to the DURHAM home and along the way
he stopped and complained that John MILLS (a neighbor) was the cause for the
problems James was having with his wife.  According to the depositions, MILLS
had written a false will for GILBERT and after leaving 20 shillings for Mrs.
GILBERT, assumed the rest of the estate for himself.  The GILBERTS had a
servant of their own, Thomas V. Longdale, who was set free by the alleged will
at GILBERT's death.  The records do not record how the suit was finally
settled.
        Curiously, neither Mary nor James GILBERT were mentioned in Alice Chinn
Stretchley's 1701 will, though they both were alive at the time.

        We don't know when Mary GILBERT died, but Thomas DURHAM Sr. signed 
his will on August 4, 1711.  He made two references to land conveyed by 
Mary GILBERT:

          Item.  I give and Bequeath unto my Dear and Loving wife Dorothy
DURHAM the use of my Plantations, together with all my Lands and Tenements
with all and Every of their Appurtenances--Profits and Commoditys ----
Belonging or appertaining for and During the ----of her natural Life and after
her Decease if my Son Thomas DURHAM and Mary his wife do by some sufficient
instrument in writing under their hands and seals and affording to due forme
of Law Release and Acquitt all and singular their Right ,title and Interest in
and unto Fifty acres of Land being the same Tract & Plantations which we had
conveyed us by Mary GILBERT unto my son John DURHAM and his heirs or pay him
the said: John DURHAM Eight Thousand Pounds of Tobacco in Lieu of His said
Land and also pay unto my Daughter Mary Dodson Fifteen hundred pounds of
Tobacco that then and upon this consideration-----aforesaid: I do give and
bequeath unto my said son Thomas DURHAM and his heirs Lawfully Begotten and
for want of such issue unto my son John DURHAM and his heirs Lawfully Begotten
and for want of such issue unto my GrandSon Thomas Dodson and his heirs. But
if my said son Thomas DURHAM doth refuse and will not release the said fifty
acres of Land nor pay the Tobacco aforesaid: I do will and Bequeath the said
Plantation whereon I now dwell with all my Lands unto my son John DURHAM and
his heirs---

Item.  I give and Bequeath unto my Son John DURHAM Fifty acres of Land more or
less being the Plantation with all the Tract and Parcell of Land that was
Conveyed us by Mary GILBERT, to have and to hold the said Tract and Parcell of
Land with the appurtainances unto my said son John DURHAM and his heirs
Lawfully begotten and for want of such issue unto my GrandSon Thomas Dodson
and his heirs-

        The will appears to be talking about the same fifty acres of land 
indentured to the DURHAMs by Mary GILBERT in 1707.  It apparently was a 
nice plantation if Thomas and Dorothy DURHAM had moved into the house by 
the time of Thomas' death!  Thomas DURHAM also seemed determined to ensure 
the property stayed within the family, assigning the plantation to second 
son John if oldest son Thomas DURHAM Jr. did not follow the instructions 
laid out by the dying man. 

        Thomas DURHAM Sr.'s assigning the property to oldest grandson 
Thomas Dodson Jr., also indicated the older man was trying to keep the 
property in the family.  This would seem to imply Mary GILBERT 
probably was a family member.
        All that being said,  Mary GILBERT probably was Dorothy, Alice 
and Thomasin's mother.  Whether their father's name was GILBERT, or 
perhaps a Thomas with another surname (to explain Thomasin's unusual 
name), is simply unknown.

Michelle,

Thanks so much for calling my attention to the Dorothy (SMOOT?) DURHAM
controversy again.  It appears we all need to study & try to make sure we
have accurate birth dates for the early Smoots (even approximate dates) in
case Harry Wright Newman or others have placed Smoots in the wrong family
grouping.

Thanks Rick Saunders for all your input on the early Smoots.  Maybe this
will help us to get a few more items hammered out and arrive at the truth
on the early Smoots.  Thanks also to Steve Smoot for his assistance now and
in the past.

Michelle, thanks for posting your DURHAM/Smoot article that you wrote last
year.  It gave some convincing arguments that one William Smoot, Sr. was
the father of Dorothy (Smoot?) DURHAM and her two sisters, Alice Chinn
Stretchley and Thomasin Marshall Goodridge.  I still feel because of
Dorothy's age, that her father would need to be William Smoot (Smute) the
immigrant who had a wife Grace (possibly his 2nd wife & not the mother of
Dorothy, Alice & Thomasin).

Now, Michelle, you also give convincing arguments that these 3 sisters
could be daughters of a Mary GILBERT also (and I believe I was the one who
steered you in this direction).  After rereading all this one more time, I
am coming up with new conclusions--unless you or others can find some holes
in my arguments.

On my web page at: 
http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prairie/5821/smoot.html

I list Dorothy (Smoot?) DURHAM as a daughter of William Smoot, Sr. & wife
Grace as a possible connection.  I also direct researchers to my Dodson
Puzzle 1 & Dodson Puzzle 2 pages: 

http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prairie/5821/dodsonpuzzle.html
http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prairie/5821/dodsonpuzzle2.html

where I've included information on this DURHAM/Smoot/Dodson puzzle which
has baffled me and others for years.  There are copies of actual wills &
deeds.  Also a letter I wrote years ago about this problem.  You may wish
to reread what Michelle posted to the Smoot List along with what is on my
Smoot & Dodson & DURHAM web pages.

Anyway, my latest conclusions are this:

Why couldn't Mary GILBERT be the mother of Thomas DURHAM, instead of
Dorothy??!!!!

In the past researchers have listed Thomas DURHAM's parents as Henry DURHAM
of Bermuda who married on 14 Feb. 1660 in Bermuda to Judith Hunt.  However,
currently we DO NOT KNOW the parents of Thomas DURHAM.

He was reported to have been born ca. 1661 (because of the above marriage
date of Henry & Judith) in Bermuda, married ca. 1680 in Richmond Co., VA to
Dorothy (Smoot? or GILBERT?) & died 1714 Richmond Co., VA.

We do not know where Thomas DURHAM was born or his year of birth.  Possibly
he was born earlier that 1660.  The only date of birth I have for Dorothy
currently is ca. 1660 (based on Thomas DURHAM's supposed birth date).  Does
anyone else have a better year of birth for Dorothy?  or for her known
sisters Alice & Thomasin?

GENE B ROOKS<VWTK60A@prodigy.com > posted several messages to the Dodson
List on Rootsweb beginning on March 5, 1998 which stated that Thomas DURHAM
who married Dorothy was definitely NOT the son of Henry DURHAM and Judith
Hunt.  He wrote to the Bermuda archives.

They sent him a copy of a case in the Court of Assize in 1734 involving an
Action of Trespass, which 
involved one Richard DURHAM of Sandys as heir to estate of Thomas DURHAM,
of the same parish.  Thomas was the son of Henry DURHAM who died in 1692. 
The cover letter also said "This seems to suggest that Thomas was living in
Bermuda and not America, though I can trace no direct proof.  I can not
locate a copy of Henry DURHAM's will, which I believe would indicate where
his son was located." 

Gene Rooks included a brief abstract of the court case.

Since we do not know the parents of Thomas DURHAM, why couldn't his mother
be the Mary GILBERT mentioned in the deeds.  If you reread the deeds, it
sounds as if Thomas DURHAM is the one receiving and passing along the
property to his family, instead of it coming in right of his wife, Dorothy.

If Mary GILBERT is the mother of Thomas DURHAM (I assume she was married
previously to a man named DURHAM), then that leaves it open for Dorothy and
her sisters to be daughters of a William Smoot, Sr.  (Was there more than
one William Smoot of the right age to be the father of Dorothy, Alice &
Thomasin? or is William the immigrant the only one old enough to be their
parents???  Did William the immigrant ever end up in VA or is he confined
only to MD?)

What do you think, Michelle?

P.S.  If this all pans out, I will need to do some major revamping on my
web pages.

Webster's Dictionary:

Convey: Law: to transfer ownership of or title to
Indenture: a legal deed or contract executed between two or more parties
Consideration: payment given in exchange for a service rendered; recompense; 
Law: something promised, given, or done that has the effect of making an 
agreement a legally enforceable contract

From the Indenture between Mary GILBERT and Thomas DURHAM and his wife 
Dorothy in 1707: "Wittnesseth that the said Mary GILBERT for good and 
valuable consideration in hand paid the receipt whereof the said Mary 
doth hereby acknowledge and of every part and parcel thereof doth 
........do give grant, bargaine sole (sell?) alienate entaile and 
confirme unto"...etc. This indenture gave the legal description of 
the land. In the Thomas DURHAM, Sr. will, he probably mentioned the 
"Tract and Plantation which we had conveyed us by Mary GILBERT" so 
he wouldn't have to give the legal description of that property.

It appears to me that Thomas and Dorothy DURHAM bought this land, 
as it adjoined the additional fifty acres William Smoot deeded to 
Thomas and Dorothy DURHAM in 1707 (their second deed of property of 
Wm. Smoot to Thomas and Dorothy DURHAM).

By deed 2 Aug 1700, "William Smoot, Sr., for love and affection for 
Dorothe DURHAM, wife of Thomas DURHAM, and her children, deeded 62 
acres of land entailing it upon their eldest son Thomas DURHAM, Jr., 
their second son John DURHAM, and their eldest daughter, 
Mary DURHAM..." If all the children of Thomas and Dorothy DURHAM d.s.p., 
"said land to descend to Ann Fox, wife of William Fox, Gentleman, 
of Lancaster County." This Ann Fox was the daughter of Dorothy's 
sister, Alice Stretchley. (At the time of this deed (1700), Mary 
DURHAM was 14, Thomas DURHAM, Jr. was 10, and John DURHAM was 2; 
Mary Smoot was 7: and Alice Stretchley's daughter Ann Fox was 18 
and already married. From this it would appear that Alice was the 
older sibling.)

This appears to be a deed for land conveyed to a close relative - 
and possibly inherited land.

According to H.W. Newman in The Smoots of Maryland and Virginia, 
Grace Smoot d. 14 Jan 1666, and Wm. Smoot, Sr. died intestate 
shortly afterwards.. by 1670 at the latest. "No record has been 
found of the appraisement of his estate nor the administration." 
Has someone found a will since then (1936) for Wm. Smoot, the 
immigrant?

From the Smoot Transportation papers into Maryland, we know 
Mrs. Grace Wood(s) had at least one daughter before marrying 
Wm. Smoot, Sr. - Elizabeth Wood(s). Elizabeth Grady, Richmond 
County, VA willed her entire estate to Mary Smoot (daughter of 
William Smoot, Jr in a will dated 1693/94 and proved 1702. Was 
this Elizabeth Woods?

Interpretation and Hypothesis

William Smoot, Sr. b. England, married and had children, came 
to Virginia; m/1 children : Richard Smoot, Thomas Smoot, 
Elizabeth Smoot, and Anne Smoot (b. 1640), first wife died 
either before or after Anne was born; Wm. m/2 Mrs. Grace 
Wood(s); had daughter Alice Smoot; moved to Maryland 1846; 
had three other children: William SMOOT, Jr., Dorothy Smoot, 
and and Tomasin Smoot.

After the death of William and Grace SMOOT, Sr.: Elizabeth 
WOODS, Alice SMOOT, William SMOOT, Jr., Dorothy SMOOT, and 
Tomasin SMOOT returned to Virginia to the family of their 
mother Mrs. Grace (UNK) Woods Smoot. The older Smoot children 
probably were married and remained in Maryland.
___________________________________

I only had copies of pages 1-6 of the Smoot book given to me, 
and wish I had seen more of this book. I don't know if there is 
anything in the rest of the book that would help or not. Neither 
the omission of Wm. Smoot, Jr. from the will of Alice Stretchley 
nor the fact that he was not a witness should suggest he wasn't 
related to Alice. The same would hold true for the other (half?) 
brothers. Alice's will was made in Lancaster County, VA; and 
William was in Richmond County, VA and the other brothers probably 
in Maryland if they were still living.

Please let me have your thoughts of this. Linda Cox is my niece, 
and this is her e-mail address where I can be reached.

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

If you only knew how many hours I have spent on these two  . . . 

This is from VIRGINIA COLONIAL ABSTRACTS, edited by Dorothy Fleet, Richmond
County Records, 1704-1724 (probably volume I of three), page 291:

(p.37) "Power of Atty.  11 June 1705.  John INGO of Farnam par. Rd. Co. to 'my
trusty and well beloved friend and brother James INGO of the abovesaid County'
to transact business.   On lines 10 and 11 the following appears 'or any other
Business that is belonging to me the said John INGO Green and by these
presents x'.  the name 'Green' introduced here may possibly be an error in the
original.  Signed John INGO.  Wit: WM SMOOT, DORRATHY X DURRAN

There is a lengthy series of depositions in Richmond County, Miscellaneous
Records, Book 1 p. 285 -287 (this was volume I) of Fleet's abstracts. [Thank
you to Gene Rook who called them to my attention quite some time ago]. The
depositions concern themselves with one JAMES GILBERT, whom we believe
probably was the husband of MARY GILBERT.  The GILBERTS lived either with the
DURHAMs or in close proximity to the DURHAMs, as well as the Ingos
and--probably--William Smoot (whose wife is never mentioned, by the way).

[Those who were with us last week, will remember some of us believe Mary
GILBERT may have been the mother of the feminine trio Dorothy, Thomazine and
Alice, albeit with a different father (Captain John Morris?--but Gene found on
the Internet his wife's name was Sarah . . . ) Glenn Gohr, on the other hand,
is now positing Mary GILBERT could have been Thomas DURHAM's mother.  You can
see why I have so many convoluted diagrams scrawled all over my house!]

Anyway, the depositions are interesting because, once again, they include
depositions by Dorothy DURHAM and William Smoot, and references to the two
in"company" together with others.  John INGO also appears in these
depositions.  I'm going to type them all out after my name--they are lengthy
with challenging spelling--and perhaps someone here can reach some conclusions
I have not thought of!

signefyed nothing and futher your Depo't sayeth not".  John Rankin.  Jurat in
Cru 2'd 9'br 1704 Recordat Test James Sherlock Cl Cur.

We never heard the outcome of this series of depositions, but obviously
someone (Mrs. GILBERT?) was contesting the will.

William Smoot Sr. gave the land "for love and affection for Dorothy DURHAM ,
wife of Thomas DURHAM and her children" on August 2, 1700.

He deeded Thomas and Dorothy DURHAM another 50 acres in 1707.  

That same year Mary GILBERT deeded the DURHAMs 50 acres of land "adjoining
William Smoot's" gift--according to Shirley Corbari in The Guio-Dodson Family.
William Smoot witnessed that deed, along with Miles Walters.  Thomas DURHAM's
1711 will made reference, twice, to that 50 acre parcel, trying to ensure the
property stayed within the family (by inheritance, it went to eldest son
Thomas DURHAM, thence to second son John DURHAM and if all else failed, to
eldest grandson Thomas Dodson, son of daughter Mary).  Reading it through
again, I can see why Glenn might think Mary GILBERT could be Thomas DURHAM's
mother.  In that case, naming his only daughter Mary, makes sense.

But who was William Smoot?  An overly kind neighbor?

Help!

Subject: [SMOOT] Dorothy DURHAM nee Smoot?
Content-Type: text/plain;

I am a descendant of Ann Smoot, daughter of William Smoot, the immigrant.

I have read with great interest all the theories surrounding Dorothy DURHAM 
as a possible daughter to immigrant, William Smoot. 

Does Dorothy DURHAM ever refer to Tomazin as a sister? Does Mary GILBERT 
ever refer to Alice or Tomazin at all?

Alice (?) Chin Stretchly lists Dorothy DURHAM, Tomazin Marshall as sisters 
and daughters Ann Fox and Catherine Heal. 

In 1700 William Smoot Sr. (married to Jane since she had to relinquish Dower 
rights) granted land for love and affection for Dorothy DURHAM and husband, 
Thomas DURHAM. In the event none of Dorothy's children survive her, then land 
goes to Ann Fox (daughter of Alice Stretchly). He does not mention Tomazin. 
This certainly indicates more than a friendship with Dorothy and the family 
of Alice. 

In 1707 Mary GILBERT grants land to Dorothy and Thomas in such a way that she 
would seem to be Dorothy's mother - and she was staying with the DURHAMs for a 
time. In 1707 when Mary granted land to Dorothy, Alice was already deceased.

Alice's birth was probably about 1655 or before since she had at least 2 grown 
children by 1701, Catherine and Ann. 

William Smoot is listed as immigrating in 1646 with wife Grace and 6 children, 
one of whom is Grace's daughter by a prior marriage. William Smoot is again 
listed as immigrating in 1646 with 2 children. How can this be the same William? 
It would seem that another William, probably a son, born about 1620-1626 
(he had 2 children by 1646) immigrated at the same time as William Sr. and was 
most likely his son. His first wife is not listed with him, so I assume she is 
deceased. Perhaps he then marries a woman named Mary and has more children. 
William (b.c.1620) then dies and Mary remarries to a man named GILBERT - 
get my drift?

William (who married Jane) Smoot, Alice Chin Stretchly and Dorothy DURHAM 
could all be children of William Smoot (b.c.1620), with at least Dorothy 
being the daughter of Mary (?) GILBERT. Therefore, William & Jane's land 
transaction of 1700 would make sense.

Tomazin could be a sister-in-law of Alice, either a sister of first husband 
Fox or second husband, Stretchly. In colonial wills sister-in-law, 
father-in-law, etc. are often referred to simply as sister, father, etc.

It's another theory. Does anyone have additional information that could 
support this or eliminate the possibility?

This information was on the Dodson List, but it may be the answer that some
of us are looking for as to the parentage of Dorothy (Smoot?) who married
Thomas DURHAM, and her sisters Alice CHINN STRETCHLY, and Thomazine
MARSHALL.

This reference reports that her maiden name was MORRIS instead of Smoot. 
We will need to review the original records.

Thanks to Vicki Annico and Gene Rooks for calling this to my attention.

I've looked at some of my records and found that the full reference to

 Vicki, thanks for clarifying that.  That will be a very important
discovery for many of the DODSON  researchers, and answer a long standing 
mystery as to the maiden name of
 the sisters Dorothy DURHAM, Alice CHINN STRETCHLY, and Thomazine
MARSHALL.

QRYTEXT: Many years ago in my research, I came across a reference to the
marriage of Thomas Dodson, b. ca 1660 and Dorothy Morris, b. ca 1663,
daughter of Captain Thomas Morris. I believe this information came from
"Marriages of Richmond Co., VA 1668-1853" by George H. S. King, Fellow. Has
anyone heard of this before?.    (Note, Vicki confirmed she meant Thomas
DURHAM
married Dorothy MORRIS)

Hi,

Glenn posted earlier a statement by way of Vicki Annico from the Dodson 
list that "Marriages of Richmond Co. 1668-1853" by Geo H. S. King stated 
that Thomas DURHAM married Dorothy Morris, daughter of Captain Thomas 
Morris.

"Marriage of Richmond County, Virginia 1668-1853" compiled by 
George H. S. King (Easley, SC: Southern Historical Press, Inc, 
1964) p. 61 states "Thomas DURHAM married 168? Dorothy___________ 
(born circa 1663), probably a relative of William Smoot, Sr......."

p. 81 states Jeremiah GREENHAM and Dorothy DURHAM (widow), license 
February 1714/15 (Dorothey DURHAM was the widow of Thomas DURHAM ......"

p. 250 asks "Who were the parents of these three sisters?" and has 
a diagram of Dorothy Alice, and Thomasin and their families.

There are Morris' in the index, but not Thomas Morris.  
Whereever Vicki Annico got the information, it was not from 
that book, unless it is on a page missed by the index.

Content-Type: text/plain;

I only recently found my Smoot connection and am new to the list. I really 
appreciate all the information I've found on the Smoot Association site and 
others, but I am so confused.

First, my line very briefly: I descend from Sarah DURHAM and William Hanks III. 
That much I have proven. From info I've found on the Web, Sarah was the daughter 
of Thomas DURHAM and Mary Smoot; Thomas was the son of Thomas DURHAM and Dorothy; 
Mary was the daughter of William Smoot and Jane. I have read the different 
theories as to the parentage of Dorothy and of William, but I don't know enough 
yet to have an opinion.

The question I have right now is, which William Smoot "for love and affection" 
deeded land to Dorothy DURHAM and her children in 1700? From what I gather, the 
first William (who married Grace) was dead long before that transaction, and his 
son, William, was Dorothy's junior, perhaps even her brother. Am I missing a 
generation somewhere?

For what it's worth, in his Bible dictionary, Rev. John Hanks, 
great-great grandson of Dorothy DURHAM, made a birth entry for 
"Tomazin Hanks." It's probably too many generations removed to mean anything, 
but I thought it interesting anyway.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Dear Researchers:

I am really researching the DURHAM family, but the Smoots are a heck of a 
lot more fun, especially since someone burst my bubble on Henry DURHAM (gov 
of Bermuda) not being the father to my Thomas DURHAM (can't Thomas have 
been born and died in Bermuda and still traveled back and forth  to 
Virginia and started a family?  Hasn't anyone heard the song ' A wife in 
every Port' or something to that effect?)

One of the Smoots below had a dau. Mary who married a Thomas DURHAM, and it 
was  thought for the last 100 years that a Dorothy ? who also married 
another Thomas DURHAM was a Smoot too, but that theory is being shot down 
somewhat (some of us are not satisfied yet!  We know Dorothy ? had two 
sisters Alice and Thomazin(sine), but don't know any of their maiden names 
- we do know who they married, however, Chinn, Stretchley, and Marshall family.

AND NOW, FOR THE SMOOT(E)(S) ET AL 
************************************************************

Boy, is it easy to get confused with all the Williams, Thomas Smoot(e) 
people.  Can someone take a look at this and perhaps just simplify the 
situation, telling me whether my assumptions are right or wrong.  Perhaps 
just furnish a simple chart of what this Smoot line should look like using 
question marks where stuff is unknown.  Feel free to send me an attachment 
to an E-mail directly to me using a rtf or doc file for MS Word, or even a 
GEDCOM file (zipped or unzipped if not long) attachment if you'd 
rather.  Thanks for any help you can give, and if I can be of help to 
anyone in the DURHAM side, just let me know.

Karen Trouvat sent this great message to the Dodson List concerning possibly
resources of information on the Dorothy who married Thomas DURHAM.  Also
other families in Bermuda & Barbados who could be related.

This gives good evidence that Dorothy could have been a MORRIS before
marriage, instead of a SMOOT.  At least we have a Dorothy and Tomasin
Morris, both daughters of Thomas Morris, Esq. of Barbados who left a will in
1695.  Also named in the will are a son Robert, son Richard, and a daughter
Frances (Morris) Terry.  Robert Swann is also listed as a son-in-law.  No
mention of a daughter named Alice.

More research needs to be done on this Morris family.

Thanks to Karen for passing this information along.

Smoot


Hello Cousins,

I thought I should copy to the list part of the message I sent to Gene Rooks
in response to a request last July concerning the notorious "Dorothy
question." Maybe everyone already has all this, or maybe it doesn't apply,
but just in case, here is what I sent:

...[These] pages, with a letter, were sent by Mary E. Crigler, Rt. 1 Box
117,
St. Joseph, LA 71366, also a descendant of Thomas DURHAM (1660) and Dorothy,
etc. She had corresponded in the early 1980s with other cousins, Mr. Eddie
Hunter and Mr. Robert Lawrence. Mrs. Crigler included these gentlemen's
1980s addresses in her letter, but I don't believe I ever contacted them directly.

Another family member with whom both Mrs. Crigler and I have corresponded
(middle 1990s) and who has done quite a bit of research is Graham Louer,
5307 Oak Lake Drive, Dallas, TX 75287.

Mrs. Crigler sent me a number of charts along with some photocopied pages of
the following books:

1) Bermuda Settlers of the 17th Century, Genealogical Notes from Bermuda,
Julia E. Mercer, Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc., Baltimore, 1982.

2) Barbados Records -- Wills and Administrations, volume I 1639 - 1680,
compiled and edited by Joanna McCree Sanders, 1979, Sanders Historical
Publications, Printed by Walsworth Publishing Co., Marceline, Mo. 64658.

3) Barbados Records -- Wills and Administrations, volume II 1681 - 1700,
compiled and edited by Joanna McCree Sanders, 1980, Sanders Historical
Publications, 13603 Pebblebrook, Houston, TX 77079.

Also in my file I found part of a photocopied page with no title, only 
a page number, 249. Given the parish names, it appears to be will 
references from Barbados:

Henry DURHAM who was made Governor of Bermuda in November 1682 on the death
of Gov. Florentius SEYMOUR married Sara [should be Judith] HUNT who with her
father and mother Richard & Sara HUNT of Bromley, Kent, arrived in Bermuda, 1647.

[Then follows an author's note explaining why Sara above should read
Judith.--KT]

On the following two pages there is quite a bit more on Richard HUNT, 
including a mention of "brother in law" John MORRIS in his will, but due 
to the condition of my photocopy (or my limited ability), I couldn't get it 
scanned.

On page 158 there is mention of "Sister Grimditch" and "nephew "Thomas 
Grimditch" in the will of Sir Nathaniel RICH, Dec. 2, 1635.

Maryland, Rent Rolls, 1639-1771, TLC Genealogy, Miami Beach, FL, 1993)

Date? Maryland Records. "William SMOOT the patentee of a Tract of Land 
lying in St. Mary's County called the Governor's Gift had three sons viz, 
William, Thomas & John. William the first son had children by two wives 
viz William & Thomas by the first wife John & two sisters by the second 
wife. Thomas the second son of the patentee had also issue Barton & 
others. John the third son of the patentee likewise had issue Edward 
& others." (Maryland Historical Society, Baltimore, Maryland, Ms 1341, 
Price) 

Price goes on to quote from a memo attached to the record that was very 
difficult to read due to water smeared words. Mentions land called SMOOTS 
Hollow surveyed by William SMOOT, mentions survey for William SMOOT 27 
June 1667 and a survey 27 June 1647. Price also listed finding a patent 
to Oliver DAVIS (Liber W.C.: 508) in 1677 called the "Governors Gift" 
in New Town Manor. Mentioned Patent of William SMOOT of June 1647, for 
"three hundred acres one hundred and fifty acres." The "Governors Gift" 
was described as on the West side of Herring Creek, containing 150 acres.

     The only William I know who had two wives, with sons William and 
Thomas by the first, and John and two daughters by the second is 4. 
William SMOOT listed above. See my posting number 1 for the evidence 
that William and Thomas were by the first wife, and John and the 
daughters were by the second. There was no date given on this 
"court case" as presented by Price. Could this have been about 
the time that 6. William SMOOT of Westmoreland County in 1719 
conveyed to 12. Barton SMOOT of Charles Co., MD all claim to 
property in MD? If so, then 10. Mary could have been deceased 
by then, and account for the listing of 2 sisters. See posting 
1 that she was probably deceased by 1733, and almost certainly 
by 1739 when her mother Eleanor wrote her will.

     The only Thomas SMOOT with a son Barton that I know of in 
this time era are 5. Thomas and 12. Barton. That 5. Thomas and 4. 
William are brothers is from a deed in 1683 where William sold land 
to his brother Thomas. Newman made the assumption that this was the 
same William SMOOT that was named in the will of William Battin as 
being the son of Battin's sister Jone SMOOT. He also assumed that 
this is the same William SMOOT that received a patent in 1671 on 
"SMOOTs Chance" as the eldest son and heir of Thomas SMOOT deceased.

     I know of no direct link stating that 5. Thomas is a son of 2. 
Thomas, only that he is a brother of 4. William. Based on the court 
case presented by Price, and the other records mentioned above, it 
would appear there were two contemporary William SMOOTs, one the son 
of William, the other the son of Thomas. My interpretation of 
reconciling all these records (using the same numbers as above is): 
1. William SMOOT

     3. William SMOOT b. ca. 1622 

          4. William SMOOT d. 1707 Westmoreland Co., VA

     I would appreciate comments/additions to this, regarding any pertinent 
records I may have overlooked, or other possible interpretations I may not 
have considered.

     If there is anyone on the list who has access to the MD Hist. Soc., a 
book I found on the manuscript collection of theirs described Ms.1341 as 
about 600 items of misc. land papers. I think it would be very interesting 
if a separate reading was the same as Price's, or if another person could 
read the difficult parts better. If it is possible to copy this document, I 
would gladly pay for the cost of the copy.

THOMAS (4) DODSON: Thomas (4) Dodson, b. May 15, 1681, in 
Richmond Co., Va., d. Nov. 21, 1740, m. Mary
DURHAM (Dau. of Thomas DURHAM and Dorothy SMOOT). [I can 
find no reference to prove that Dorothy's maiden
name was SMOOT--gg] They lived in North Farham Parish in 
Richmond Co., Va. Records on this family are recorded
in the North Farnham Register. There are wills and deeds 
on record in Richmond Co., Va., on the DURHAM family
and the SMOOTs family. H. W. Newman makes reference to 
William SMOOT, Sr.., in his book "The SMOOTs of
Maryland and Virginia" (Washington, 1936), pages 5 and 
6. (Thomas DURHAM's will is recorded in WILL BOOK 3,
pages 210, 211, 212, Richmond Co., Va.) Mary was b. 
June 5, 1686, Thomas (4) Dodson's will dated Feb. 17, 
1739
proved March 1740 Richmond Co., Va. It is the children 
of this Thomas who went to Southwest Virginia, settling in
Pittsylvania Co., Va., prior to May 1767. 

From 1676 (Bacon's Rebellion) until 1776 (Revolutionary 
War) Virginia had a gradual growth in population and 
continual quarrels with royal governors. As new immigrants 
arrived, the frontier was pushed further westward until the 
settlements reached the mountains. In their quarrel with the 
governors the people gained more and more privileges and 
acquired more and more ability to manage their own affairs. 
A notable event of this period was the establishment of 
William and Mary College at Williamsburg in 1694. Children: 

a. George (5) MORE LATER
b. David (5) possibly eldest child, son of Thomas and Mary Dodson,
m. Amey, surname unknown, settled in Prince William Co. where he
died 1740, prior to the death of his father.  He had an only child, a
daughter born after his death who probably died young since his
estate eventually went to his brothers, all of whom are named in his
will dated April 27, 1740, proved July 28, 1740.
c.  Thomas (5) m. (1) Elizabeth Rose (2) Mrs. Eleanor Sloan, a
widow.  He settled in Pittsylvania Co., Va.
d. Greenham (5) m. Elinor Hightower.
e. Alice (5) m. a Creel.
f. Mary (5) m. an Oldham.
g. Abraham (5) b. April 4, 1923 [should be 1723--gg], m. Barbary,
removed to Farquier Co., Va. where he died; will proved Oct. 25,
1768.
h. Joshua (5) b. May 25, 1725, no further record.
i. Elisha (5) b. Feb. 22, 1727, m. an Averett, settled in Pittsylvania
Co., Va.

Some of the above information may be found in Rev. Silas Emmett 
Lucas's 2-vol. book, and with some updated
information. I thought this would be helpful.

*This appears to say there were two William Smoots running around the 
northern neck at the same time.  Westmoreland County is the county due 
north of Richmond County.

*Another interesting point which we haven't discussed lately, is who was 
Elizabeth Grady of Richmond County?: 

Elizabeth Grady of Richmond County, Virginia, willed to Mary Smoot 'the 
daughter of William Smoot' her entire landed estate, but in the event 
that Mary died without issue then to William Smoot and his heirs.  The 
latter received all personal property and was named executor.  The will 
dated March 4, 1693/4 and was not proved until November 4, 1702 by Thomas 
DURHAM and Richard DRAPER.

*(Mary would have been an infant in 1693 and her twin sisters were not born 
until 1698.  I have a CONJECTURE in my notes: this wouldn't have been William 
Smoot's sister Elizabeth Smoot Athwickes, would it?  Or could she perhaps be 
related to Mrs. Jane Smoot?).

Hi Lorie,

I have also looked into the identity of William the immigrant, 
William of Richmond Co.,  Va who married Jane, and my William of 
Westmoreland Co., VA who married first Anne -?- and secondly married 
Eleanor AUSTIN.  I too had wondered if the 1646 record where William 
was listed with two children was the same as William the immigrant, 
or perhaps a son born in the 1620s.  I had never seen this adequately 
explained in anything in print of how these records of William with 
two children and William with 6 children were the same person. Abstracts 
in print of these records did not include enough information. From 
reading of the original records, I offer the explanation below.

I'm listing here part of a post I made to this list on 8 Apr. 1999.  
My conclusion is that the records of the warrants and grants show 
only one William SMOOT.  If there was a son born in the 1620s of 
William the immigrant, if can't be shown from these land records. 
See my reasoning below.


p. 1. 6 Apr. 1646 "William SMOOT demandath 300 Acres of Land by 
Conditions of Plantation for bringing into the Province of his 
own Charge in the Year 1646 himself and his Wife and his two 
Children." "Thomas BUSHELL demandeth 50 acres of Land assd him 
by William SMOOT." Patent to William SMOOT for transportation of 
his wife and two children in the year 1646 ...... on Herring 
Creek.....adjacent to Thomas BUSHELL.... 300 acres.....given 
12 June 1647  (On the side in a different (modern) handwriting 
is "SMOOTE."  I believe these may have been done when the MD Hall 
of Records was preparing an index to tract names.) 
(FHL microfilm 13064, MD patents, Liber ABH (Vol. 4)

p.41 4 June 1649 "William SMOOTE demandath One hundred Acres of 
Land for Transporting two Children into this Province in or about 
the Year 1646." "Warrant to lay out for William SMOOT One Hundred 
Acres of Land on the South Side of the Herring Creek between the 
Land of Robert KEDGER and Walter BEANE." (FHL microfilm 13064, 
MD patents, Liber ABH (Vol. 4) extracted by Rick Saunders who 
states not ROANS as stated by HWN, but BEANE per film)

p. 147 27 Mar. 1651 William BRUGH received patent on 300 acres 
(on side written "Brough") "near unto Land formerly Granted to 
Willm SMOOT." (FHL microfilm 13064, MD patents, Liber ABH (Vol. 4) 
extracted by Rick Saunders)

p. 154 4 June 1651 400 acres laid out on the west side of the 
Wiccomico River....for Will: SMOOT. (FHL microfilm 13064, 
MD patents, Liber ABH (Vol. 4) extracted by Rick Saunders)

p. 230 13 Nov. 1652 "William SMOOTES his Titles for Land Viz. 
for Transporting himself Grace his Wife Thomas Richard Elizabeth 
Ann and Ales SMOOTE his Sons and Daughters and Elizabeth WOOD his 
Wives Daughter about the year 1646 and Ann WOODNOT his Servant 
about two Years Since upon which Rights he took up Three Hundred 
Acres upon the Herring Creek and Four Hundred Acres since upon 
Wiccohomico River." (FHL microfilm 13064, MD patents, Liber ABH 
(Vol. 4) extracted by Rick Saunders)

p. 242 26 Jan. 1652         Laid out for  Will: SMOOTE land on 
the west side of Wiccohomico River....400 acres. (FHL microfilm 
13064, MD patents, Liber ABH (Vol. 4) extracted by Rick Saunders)

p. 243 26 Jan. 1652        Patent to Will: SMOOT of 400 acres 
"for Transporting Elizabeth Ann and Alis SMOOTE his Daughters and 
Elizabeth WOOD his Wive's Daughter in to our said Province before 
the year 1651...." (to side in different handwriting is written 
Atwicks Purchase) (FHL microfilm 13064, MD patents, Liber ABH 
(Vol. 4) extracted by Rick Saunders)

The information is somewhat ambiguous, but it appears to likely 
be but one William Smoot. The 13 Nov. 1652 record shows that the 
William who received the 300 acre tract on Herring Creek 
("Smoot") , and the 400 acre tract on the Wiccohomico River 
("Atwicks Purchase") were the same person.  The patent for the 
400 acre "Atwicks Purchase" shows this was for transportation of 
his wife and 3 daughters.  The warrant for "Smoote" was listed for 
transportation of himself, wife, and two children.  He would have 
been entitled to 400 acres here, but only received a patent on 300 
acres (presumably for himself and two sons), thus using his wife's 
transportation later on "Atwicks Purchase." What is confusing is 
the 4 June 1649 warrant for 100 acres for transportation of himself 
and two children.  If this is a different William Smoot, he should 
have been entitled to 300 acres, not 100 acres. If this is the same 
William Smoot, he shouldn't have been entitled to any land, as he 
had already received the 300 acre "Smoote" for those threes 
transportation. The only explanation I can figure is that he 
was trying to get the additional 100 acres that he didn't get 
when he got only a 300 acre patent, for transportation of 
himself, wife and two children, when he was entitled to 400 
acres.  Technically then the warrant should have only mentioned 
transportation of one person, not three.  Although there is the 
warrant, I don't find a patent for this 100 acres.  It would 
appear  he didn't follow through on this, and decided then to 
transfer his wife's transportation to the 400 acre "Atwicks 
Purchase."

No mention of land claimed for his wife's daughter Elizabeth 
Wood, and servant Ann Woodnot.  There is the mention of 50 
acres being assinged to Thomas Bushnell, possibly he assigned 
the rights of  the other 150 acres, also.

William SMOOT I, presumably the immigrant, was probably the same first 
recorded in 1640 in the records of York County, Virginia:

That William SMOOT was the same as William SWEETE/SMEETE is documented by 
adjoining land patents:

Only one other possible SMOOT is found in the records of York County:

1 Oct 1645. York County Records, No. 2. P. 139. John BELL of Queens Creek, 
planter, assigns to John WILLIAMS the above 250 acres lying in Hampton 
Parish, etc. s/John BELL. Wits: Arthur PRICE, Thomas DEACON. 20 Apr 1642

Tho GIBSON'S, and another dividend of Samuel WATKEYS [sic] [WATKINS]. 
(Per BF, this signed with a name appearing to be Thomas SMOUT, which is 
probably incorrect since part of it is torn away). 

CH: John BELL patented 100 acres in then Charles River County on 1 Oct 1639, 
described as "upon Queens Creek, adjacent land of Henry JONES and John 
HARTWELL" (VA Land Patent Book No. 1-Part II, p. 675). Samuell WATKEYES 
had patented 150 acres in then Charles River County on 15 Aug 1838 
described as "in Queens creek and behind land now seated by John BELL, 
southwest into the woods and land of John HARTWELL on the North." (ibid., 
p. 589). John HARTWELL had patented 650 acres in Charles River on 18 Feb 
1638, described as "North upon Queens Creek, bounded on East with land of 
John BELL, south southwest into the woods a mile, thence joyning land of 
Samuell WATKEYES, from thence running down the Mayden Swamp untill it meete 
with Queens Creek." (ibid., p. 611). Samuel WATKEYES patented a second 
tract on 5 Nov 1639, 250 acres described as in Charles River County 
"adj. John UTYE, westerly from the head of Kings Creek to the Mayden

(ibid., p. 688). Nicholas COMEINGS (COMINGS) patented 200 acres in 
Charles River County on 1 Sep 1639, described as upon Utye's Creek 
adjacent Robert PITWAY and Richard FORD (ibid., p. 688). 

There was also a Thomas STOUTE who patented 300 acres in James 
County on 29 Oct 1639 "North upon Richard BELL, and West upon 
George UNWIN etc." (Virginia Patent Book No. 1-Part II),

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our sample below, the 
<A HREF="long-s.html">long &#0147;s&#0148;</A> is seen as both a 
stand alone letter (the second &#0147;shalt&#0147;) and in a number of two letter 
ligatures, &#0147;sh, ss, se, and st&#0148;. The letter &#0147;v&#0148; is seen doing 
double duty as a &#0147;v&#0148; (as in <I>live</I> and <I>love</I>) 
and as a &#0147;u&#0148; (as in <I>cursing</I>). <BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper case &#0147;I&#0148; is used in <I>Isaac</I> and 
also stands in for a &#0147;J&#0148; in <I>Iacob</I> (</I>Jacob</I>). It 
would seem the letter &#0147;J&#0148; 
(a <A HREF="i-j-letters.html">late developing letter</A>) had 
not yet fully taken its place in the printer type case. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another (a <A HREF="vv-w.html">late developing 
letter </A>is the &#0147;w&#0148;, however, there are three &#0147;modern&#0148; 
versions seen in our sample. <BR><BR>

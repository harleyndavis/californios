&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thorn starts with a Runic character 
which has a &#0147;th&#0148; sound.  It looked much like our modern letter 
&#0147;p&#0148; but made with straight lines. The straight lines were probably 
adopted because of ease of carving into stone and wood. In time, the Runic thorn 
transitioned to the handwritten letter and came to be known as the Anglo-Saxon thorn. 
Today, we can see it as used in the modern 
Icelandic alphabet.  <CENTER><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 1454-55, Johannes Gutenberg printed 
his famous Bible with movable type, thus making obsolete the handwritten books of his age.
In 1476, William Caxon set up a printing press at Westminster England. Caxton and other early 
English printers purchased movable type from the Continent. It is said that the purchased 
type sets did not contain the character &#0147;thorn.&#0148; So they used the letter 
&#0147;y&#0148; to fill the gap in the type set and the English &#0147;y&#0148; became 
an adaptated &#0147;thorn.&#0148; The superscript ending letter (or letters) finished the word, 
such as the &#0147;y<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>e</SUP></FONT>&#0148; which is pronounced 
&#0147;the&#0148; <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the &#0147;y&#0148; word ended with a 
&#0147;t&#0148; or an &#0147;at&#0148; (&#0147;y<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>t</SUP></FONT>&#0148; 
or &#0147;y<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>at</SUP></FONT>&#0148;) we would have &#0147;that.&#0148; <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An underscore or dot written under the ending 
superscripted letter(s) is not significant. Also, not all writers superscripted the 
ending letter(s). <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Printed thorns generally were not used in 
Middle English works after 1600. However, manuscripts, documents, and letters 
continued to use the thorn for perhaps another 125 years. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer: when &#0147;the&#0148; is &#0147;you.&#0148; Two 
versions from the Bible: 
&#0147;Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.&#0148; and 


&#0147;You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you.&#0148; --John, 15-14. <BR><BR>

Note: <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Old English 
ye was used only as a nominative, and
you only as a dative or objective. In the 16th century,
however, ye and you became confused and were often used
interchangeably, both as nominatives and objectives,
and you has now superseded ye except in solemn or
poetic use. </FONT> <BR>

Often seen are the &#0147;X&#0148; marks of folk who count not write their own 
names. Once the person made their X, the court clerk or attorney would add the 
person&#0146s given name in front of the X, the surname behind the X, a 
&#0147;his&#0148; or &#0147;her&#0148; above the X, and &#0147;mark&#0148; below the 
X. Sometimes a person might &#0147;make their mark&#0148; with a cross (+), their initials, or some 
other symbol. If the instrument (document) was recorded, the clerk would copy it into 
his record books, the X and all. Almost all the signatures and marks that we see in those 
books are the in the clerk&#0146s hand.  <BR><BR>

Perhaps the most important consideration about X marks is this: just because 
a person was illiterate, it does not mean that they were stupid. If fact, there has 
been many illiterate people who were successful businessmen.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Then there were the folk who could write their own names but no more. They could in 
a way, fake their own literacy. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Just because a person made his mark in his will does not mean he was illiterate. People frequently 
make their will in their old age or when they are seriously ill. Even literate people may have to make their mark 
under these circumstances. I know of two examples of literate people who made their mark on their wills. 
One was referred to as Schoolmaster in a deed as a young man, but when he made his will in the 1860s, he 
made his mark - the 1850 census included the annotation that he was blind. The other example I know of is 
one of my greatgrandfathers. I have examples of his handwriting when he was middle-aged and in good health, but 
he made his will when he was 84 years old and in very poor health, and made his mark. <BR><BR><BR>

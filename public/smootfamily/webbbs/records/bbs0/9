<P>Following is a transcript of the record. There is a small rectangular section missing from the edge of the first page. From the context of the document, and other records referred to, I have in places within brackets filled in what I believe these missing parts may have said. For the second part where the memorandum begins, there are no missing parts, but some words are illegible on the photocopy, and those parts are also within brackets. Any use of parenthesis is as found in the document.
<P>Begin document:
<P>A suite of Jno. Smoots Case of Govr. Gift also a Deed from Wm. Smoot to Barton from Charles Coty. Recd. with a plat of all the lands around.
<P>William Smoot the patentee of a Tract of Land Lying in St. Marys County Called the Governors Gift had three sons viz. William Thomas &amp; John, Wm. the first son had Children by two Wives viz. William &amp; Thomas by the first Wife John &amp; two sisters by the second Wife. Thomas the second son of the pattentee had also Issue Barton &amp; others. John the third son of the pattentee likewise had Issue Edward &amp; others. Wm. the pattentee dies &amp; does not Bequeath the sd. Land to anyone. Wm. his son also dies without devising the same or being possessed thereof. Wm. the Grandson of the Pattentee makes a D[eed of conveyance] to his Lands in Maryland by deed of Bargain &amp; s[ells to Barton son] of Thomas the second son of the pattentee (for the condsid[eration of 5 shillings] Curnt. money) w[hi]ch Deed is acknowledged &amp; Recorded in [Maryland for] the afsd. Tract of Land lies in St. Mary Coty. and the [.....] since the Act for enrolling Deeds etc. as appears by th[.....&amp; whether] the sd. Deed is good as Wm. the Grandson nor Bart[on son of Thomas ever] entered on the Lands or ever possessed the same &amp; if [the sd. John is heir] in Law as William &amp; Thomas the gransons of the [sd. patentee are both] dead &amp; their Issue &amp; never entered the Land they nor their Issue or possessed the same in any manner. Qn. Whether the afsd. Land descends to John their brother by the father being the Grandson to the Pattentee &amp; son of Wm. (the first son) by second Wife, or Descends to Barton the son of Thoms the second son of the pattentee, In case John the Grandson to the pattentee &amp; son of Wm. shd. have the Right to the Land by descent from his father or grandfather, whether the act of Limitation is against him as the persons in possession of the sd Land has had it possession above 20 years, the sd. Johns Right did not accrue to him till the year 1747 or fell by the Death of the Issue of Wm. &amp; [Thos.] the Grandsons of the pattentee &amp; sons of Wm. the first son being father to Jno.
<P>To make the state of the Case the easier to be understood I have below Noted the descents of the Smoot family---
<P>William Smoot the above pattentee had three sons
<P>William (first son )---Wm. &amp; Thomas by the first wife had Issue John &amp; two sisters by the Second
<P>Thomas (second son)----Barton &amp; others
<P>John 3d----Edward &amp; others
<P>Wm. &amp; Thos. by the first wife are dead &amp; their Issue Qn. the Deed that the afsd. Wm. give to Barton son of Thomas (who was the second son) shd. not be good for Reason before observed whether the Land descends to John son of Wm. the fist son of the pattentee (tho by a second Wife) or to Barton son of Thomas who was second son of the pattentee as I before observed. that Wm. &amp; Thomas the sons of Wm. (first son of the pattenteee) by the first wife never Intered or possessed the afsd Land ?thn? I apprehend makes a good deal of Difference where Land goes by Descent. [.........] An whether has been out of Possession [........] whether that will not bar him.

<P>p. 133 Newman stated: &quot;Sometime after 1690 his wife Anne died, and he married secondly Eleanor ----. From his will, it would seem to indicate that his three daughters had obtained majority and therefore could easily be of the first union. His sons, being minors at his death, could possibly be of the second wife.&quot;
<P>p. 134 Newman stated: &quot;A deed in 1717 shows that his widow was unmarried and that a posthumous son was born after the writing of his will. Eleanor Smoot, on December 5, 1717, deeded to her son John Smoot in the presence of Nathaniel Pope, Rebecca Bryant, and John Elliot for natural love and affections certain goods and chattels at the age of 18 years. His widow, however, later married John Austin and lived in St. Mary's County, Maryland, where she died intestate in 1747.&quot;
<P>Court records show that show Eleanor was born Eleanor VEALE and that she first married William SMOOT, second William TRIGG between 1709 and 1712, and then third John AUSTIN. See records and sources at link at bottom of message:
<P>His daughter Mary had definitley not attained majority when William wrote his will in 1706, as in 1717 she chose a guardian [her uncle John VEALE], showing she was a minor, but at least 14 years old. [See link at bottom]
<P>William's son William was of age to be a witness in court in 1713 [see link at bottom], implying he was probably born before William's marriage to Eleanor, and a child of Anne. Read a transcript of William's 1706 will at: http://pweb.netcom.com/~fzsaund/smootwill1.html The wording to me implies that William and Thomas were children of William by his first wife, and that he needed to state they were to be under the care of Eleanor, as she was not their biological mother. John and the three daughters were children by William's second wife Eleanor, exactly the opposite of what Newman stated. This is supported by the bequests in Eleanor's will to her daughters and children of them, but her step-son William was not mentioned.
<P>Eleanor also did not die intestate as Newman stated. Her will is recorded in Maryland wills 24: 385. This will is incorrectly abstracted in *The Maryland Calendar of Wills.&quot; See http://home.netcom.com/~fzsaund/smootwill3.html for a transcript of her will.

<P>I believe that Hezekiah Briscoe Smoot's wife Elizabeth (see p. 113) was Elizabeth Lawrason, daughter of James Lawrason and Alice Levering of Alexandria, VA, and that he (HBS) died before November 1804 because I found a citation that his will was administered 11-10-1804 (I believe in Alexandria, VA) Elizabeth Smoot, Wilson Smoot, administrators. Their daughter, Susanna W. Smoot married Samuel McLean June 1820.

<P>I am related to a Jerry D. and Mary F. Smoot of Lynchburg, Va. He was born 1893, died 1985 and she was born in 1894 and died in 1986. His father and mother was George and Sally Smoot of Lynchburg, Madison Heights. Don't know if there are any connections here. I don't have any details of their birth/death.
<P>Steve

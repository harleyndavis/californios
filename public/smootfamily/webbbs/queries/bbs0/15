<P>I am looking for information about my Gr. Grandfather, William Edward Smoot. I believe he was born around Roanoke, VA. in the late 1800's. He moved to NY where my Grandfather, James Eugene Smoot was born (Buffalo, NY).
<P>Our branch of the family still live in NY with the exception of my Father, James Ernest Smoot who has retired to Florida.
<P>Any information would be apprciated.
<P>Thanks,
<P>JW Smoot

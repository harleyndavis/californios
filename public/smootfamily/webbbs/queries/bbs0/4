<P>Thomas Middleton SMOOT, b. ca.1790, prob. VA, m. prob. 1809, (Mary?) Venettie KENNEDY (Cannaday?), b. ca 1790. Thomas is enumerated on 1810 and 1820 Culpeper County VA censuses, Thomas buys land 1820 in Culpeper County on Norman Ford Road in northeast Culpeper. Apparently during the 1820s, wife Venettie and daughter Mary die, probably in Culpeper. Thomas M. Smoot and sons Daniel Smoot and William Smoot move to Warren County TN. It is possible that there was a second daughter, an Elizabeth Smoot. It is believed that this Elizabeth married James Anderson of Warren during the 1820s. Thomas M. Smoot may have Prince William County VA connections. I am looking for tombstones, Bible records, Smoot family connections, etc.

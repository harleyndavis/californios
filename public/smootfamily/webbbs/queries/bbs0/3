<P>MARGARET SMOOT (1793-1851) married William Briggs Davis. He was son of Aquilla Davis of Fauquier Co. VA and proved will of John Smoot according to pg. 88 of Smoots of Maryland. Davis, Briggs and Smoots are listed as VA patriots in Revolutionary War. I am seventh generation and looking for lineage of this Smoot ancestor. Any ideas?

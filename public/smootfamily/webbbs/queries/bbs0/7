<P>Hi all! I have a JOHN SMOOT B:11 May 1755 Charles Co MD, he married ANNA CANADY in 1798 in Culpepper VA and died in HARDIN CO KY in 1845. He was the supposed son of JOHN B:1725/1726 son of JOHN B:abt 1691 &amp; POSTHUMA FORD. I think JOHN 1755 was a child of the 1st wife of JOHN 1725/26. Can anyone straighten me out on this? JOHN 1755 had a son ELIJAH who married Elizabeth JONES. Thanks for any help you can give.
<P>Aleeah Livengood

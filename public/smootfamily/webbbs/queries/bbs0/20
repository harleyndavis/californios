<P>I am writing a biography of a notorious nineteenth century bomber, William King Thomas. Luther Rice Smoot (Quartermaster, Confederate State of Virginia) figures in this story because Thomas swindled him out of $25,000 during their Civil War blockade running days. Smoot chased Thomas, also known as Alexander Thompson or Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Keith, as he fled from Halifax to New York to St. Louis. I'd be interested if there are any family stories or family documents that might mention this aspect of Smoot history. Thanks!

<DIV ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best of the medieval blacksmith&#0146;s 
art was the armor 
produced by the European &#0147;armourers.&#0148; There developed in Europe, exquisite 
armor fit for princes and kings. The advent of the matchlock gun put an end to the 
battlefield use of full body armor, but the making of this type of armor continued 
for an extensive period. Jousting was the sport of knights and the royal houses 
so production of fine armor was a necessity.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shown here on the left are two examples of German armor, 
a full body armor and an embossed steel 
helmet, both images from photographs taken by my wife, Patty Smoot, 
at the great <A HREF="http://www.metmuseum.org/"><I>Metropolitan Museum of Art</I></A> 
in New York City. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first European armor in the Americas was that of the Spanish 
conquistadores as they conquered Mexico and Peru and later explored what was to be become 
the United States. The first English armor in the British American colonies was that 
of the soldiers who garrisoned the 
ill-fated Roanoke colony, 1580s, followed by the establishment of the Virginia colony at 
James Fort (Jamestown), 1607. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Armor played only a small and rather unsuccessful part 
in early Virginia history. So why even mention Medieval Armor on 
an <I>American Blacksmith</I> website? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason is that 
the medieval European armor set the standard for fine blacksmithing. Those old time smiths 
hammered out (forged) sheet plates from hunks of steel and welded the plates together into 
usable pieces. From there, they created body armor and one piece helmets. They embossed the helmets 
and produced incredible art. When the <I>Metropolitan Museum of Art</I> was assembling its 
collection, it had its own armourer. Today, there are a few American armourers still making 
fine armor. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My own favorite Ladysmith and my Goodwife, Patty Smoot, is caught torturing 
a hot mild steel rod on a Peter Wright anvil - and yes, those are pink leather 
<I>Lady-gloves</I>&nbsp; she is wearing. In the background is the 
Pro-Forge and two propane tanks. 
The next image shows the side ports of the forge. 
Side ports are a necessity in doing blacksmithing. The last image shows Adam Clark with the 
front door of the forge open. Adam is our teacher, 
mentor, and friend. He is a master metalsmith although he won&#0146;t admit it - 
and yes, that is a pink shirt Adam is wearing. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These small portable propane fueled gas forges are much 
used by modern day farriers and many blacksmiths. These propane type forges are made 
by <A HREF="http://www.forgemaster.com/home.html">Forgemaster</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.nctoolco.com/">NC Tool</A>, and others. Many farrier supply 
houses stock gas forges.

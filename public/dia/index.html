&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>D&#0237;a de los Muertos</I> or Day of the 
Dead, is also known as <I>Fiesta de los Muertos</I>. It is a holiday (or festival) 
which is celebrated in M&#0233;xico, Central and South America, and in some areas 
of the United States, especially, the southwest.
This holiday originates with the indigenous native pre-Hispanic peoples 
of M&#0233;xico. These early people believed that the souls of the dead return 
each year to visit with their living relatives. When the Spaniards arrived 
in the early fifteen hundreds, they found well established native religions. 
The Aztec people held rituals that included the use of skulls. To the Aztec, skulls were 
used to symbolize death and rebirth. The Spanish priests perceived the rituals to 
be barbaric and pagan. The priests made an extreme attempt to assimilated 
indigenous people into the Catholic Church. Assimilation occasionally 
proved difficult when these people already had their own holy days. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Aztec ritual was originally held in summer during the Aztec month of 
Miccailhuitontli, approximately corresponds to 24 July through 12 August. 
The Catholic Church moved the 
ritual to the beginning of November to coincide with two Catholic holidays, All Saints&#0146; 
Day, a Christian Feast that honors and remembers all Christian 
saints, kept on the first of November, and All Souls Day, the commemoration of 
all the faithful departed, celebrated on the second of November. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The early Spaniards merged the ritual within the two Catholic holidays, 
in the hopes that <I>D&#0237;a de los Muertos</I> would disappear forever. What 
has happened is that the traditional native holiday has become intermixed with 
the Catholic tradition but still exists.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Today, in many M&#0233;xican localities the first of November is the day for 
remembrance of deceased infants 
and children, often referred to as <I>D&#0237;a de los Angelitos
</I> or day of little angels. Those who have died as adults are 
honored on the second of November. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The <I>D&#0237;a de los Muertos</I> fiesta varies somewhat by region and by degree of urbanization.
In rural Mexico, people visit the cemeteries where their loved ones are interred. 
Home altars also take a major part in the festival. 
It is believed that the souls of the departed are 
attracted to the home altars made beautiful with flowers, baked goods, candies, fruits, and religious figures.  
The festivals are decorated with <I>calaveras</I> or skulls, animated figures of <I><A HREF="calacas.jpg">calacas</A></I> 
or skeletons, and yellow-orange <I>zempasuchils</I> or marigolds.
